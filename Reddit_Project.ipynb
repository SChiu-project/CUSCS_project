Es probable que la reducción de la inflación requiera un período sostenido de crecimiento por debajo de la tendencia. Además, es muy probable que se suavicen las condiciones del mercado laboral. Si bien las tasas de interés más altas, el crecimiento más lento y las condiciones del mercado laboral más suaves reducirán la inflación, también traerán algunos problemas a los hogares y las empresas. Estos son los costos desafortunados de reducir la inflación. Pero el hecho de no restaurar la estabilidad de precios significaría un dolor mucho mayor.\n",

            "La economía de EE. UU. claramente se está desacelerando desde las tasas de crecimiento históricamente altas de 2021, que reflejaron la reapertura de la economía luego de la recesión pandémica. Si bien los últimos datos económicos han sido mixtos, en mi opinión, nuestra economía continúa mostrando un fuerte impulso subyacente. El mercado laboral es particularmente fuerte, pero está claramente desequilibrado, con una demanda de trabajadores que excede sustancialmente la oferta de trabajadores disponibles. La inflación está muy por encima del 2 por ciento, y la alta inflación ha continuado propagándose a través de la economía. Si bien las lecturas de inflación más bajas para julio son bienvenidas, la mejora de un solo mes está muy por debajo de lo que el Comité necesitará ver antes de que estemos seguros de que la inflación está bajando.\n",
            "\n",
            "Estamos moviendo nuestra postura de política a propósito a un nivel que será lo suficientemente restrictivo para regresar la inflación al 2 por ciento. En nuestra reunión más reciente en julio, el FOMC elevó el rango objetivo para la tasa de fondos federales de 2.25 a 2.5 por ciento, que está en el rango de estimaciones del Resumen de Proyección Económica (SEP) de donde se proyecta que la tasa de fondos federales se asiente. el plazo más largo. En las circunstancias actuales, con una inflación muy por encima del 2 por ciento y un mercado laboral extremadamente ajustado, las estimaciones neutrales a largo plazo no son un lugar para detenerse o hacer una pausa.\n",
            "\n",
            "El aumento de julio en el rango objetivo fue el segundo aumento de 75 puntos básicos en otras tantas reuniones, y dije entonces que otro aumento inusualmente grande podría ser apropiado en nuestra próxima reunión. Ahora estamos a la mitad del período entre reuniones. Nuestra decisión en la reunión de septiembre dependerá de la totalidad de los datos entrantes y la evolución de las perspectivas. En algún momento, a medida que la postura de la política monetaria se endurezca aún más, probablemente será apropiado reducir el ritmo de los aumentos.\n",
            "\n",
            "Restaurar la estabilidad de precios probablemente requerirá mantener una política restrictiva durante algún tiempo. Los registros históricos advierten fuertemente contra la relajación prematura de la política. Las proyecciones individuales más recientes de los participantes del comité del SEP de junio mostraron que la tasa de fondos federales promedio se ubicaba ligeramente por debajo del 4 por ciento hasta fines de 2023. Los participantes actualizarán sus proyecciones en la reunión de septiembre.\n",

            "Nuestras deliberaciones y decisiones sobre política monetaria se basan en lo que hemos aprendido sobre la dinámica de la inflación tanto de la inflación alta y volátil de las décadas de 1970 y 1980, como de la inflación baja y estable del último cuarto de siglo. En particular, nos basamos en tres lecciones importantes.\n",
            "\n",
            "La primera lección es que los bancos centrales pueden y deben asumir la responsabilidad de lograr una inflación baja y estable. Puede parecer extraño ahora que los banqueros centrales y otros alguna vez necesitaron ser convencidos en estos dos frentes, pero como ha demostrado el ex presidente Ben Bernanke, ambas proposiciones fueron ampliamente cuestionadas durante el período de la Gran Inflación.1 Hoy, consideramos que estas preguntas están resueltas. Nuestra responsabilidad de ofrecer estabilidad de precios es incondicional. Es cierto que la alta inflación actual es un fenómeno global y que muchas economías de todo el mundo enfrentan una inflación tan alta o más alta que la que se ve aquí en los Estados Unidos. También es cierto, en mi opinión, que la alta inflación actual en los Estados Unidos es producto de una fuerte demanda y una oferta restringida, y que las herramientas de la Fed funcionan principalmente en la demanda agregada. Nada de esto disminuye la responsabilidad de la Reserva Federal de llevar a cabo nuestra tarea asignada de lograr la estabilidad de precios. Claramente, hay un trabajo que hacer para moderar la demanda para alinearla mejor con la oferta. Estamos comprometidos a hacer eso.\n",

The distinguish feature of humans is that we created tools to get the most economic value possible with the least amount of labor and natural resources. You have to convert your labor to capital while you’re young so you can live off your investments instead of your labor when you get old. So many people have no idea how this works and hate the system after the fact. Democracy screws over people who don’t learn how to vote. Capitalism screws over people who don’t learn how to invest.

The pain of loss is knowledge being brutally shoved into their heads. There’s no more edge for the already rich, powerful, and well connected anymore.

Unions are a horrible way to organize workers. They are a democratic process that consist of votes. But you don't have time to do that when you're trying to execute under time pressure. Militaries are completely authoritarian. Companies are largely authoritarian as well. Democracy is great when you're trying to get things right, slowly. Authoritarian systems work when you're trying to do things quickly the best you can. Unions introduce democracy into what should be a fast authoritarian system. Instead, workers/investors should use democracy/decentralized decision making when allocating capital and picking corporate leaders. Then the corporation should be relatively authoritarian and execute quickly. It's like how a judge jury, prosecutor, and defense attorney are all four distinct jobs with four distinct roles in a trial. The same person can have all four jobs at different times in their life. But when they are fulfilling a specific role in a single case, they need to fulfill it the best they can.\n",

Instead of disrupting that, we should just expand the ownership out to everyone in society.\n",

            "The irony of all this is that capitalism is the most progressive/liberal economic idea ever created. Liberalism was created specifically in response to authoritarianism/monarchies. Liberalism means democracy, capitalism, and individual liberties. It spreads out the power and money from one king to everyone in society. Democracy was originally limited to white men in America, but the solution to the unfairness wasn't to get rid of democracy. It was to expand it to everyone including women and racial/ethnic minorities. Similarly, capitalism took power from the king and nobility and spread it out over a bunch more rich people. But the solution to wealth/income inequality isn't to kill it. It's to expand it to every single person in society. I'm never going to vote against my interests to benefit you. I'm relying on you to vote for your own interests so the best ideas come out on top. If you don't vote, then you're going to get screwed. Similarly, I'm expecting you to pursue your own financial interests, and I'm going to pursue mine. Like with voting, we can cooperate, compete, or focus on completely different things. But I'm expecting you to try to make money. If you're only relying on your labor and not on capital, then you're going to end up broke and there's going to be massive income/wealth inequality. The hardest part is that if you screw up early, you'll have less money/ability to dig yourself out of the hole. So there's a very strong incentive to get this right up front. That's what this sub is very indirectly about. \n",

It's absurd that capitalism and profit have become demonized by the left. I genuinely believe it comes from a place of ignorance. It's not anyone's fault. Economics/capitalism/investing is not taught in most high schools and it's not a required class in most colleges. Meanwhile, politics/democracy/voting is taught in basically every year of K-12 education. This is the biggest knowledge gap in America. The annoying part about this for me is that I'm completely left wing in pretty much ever sense of the word. But I was fortunate enough to study economics in school, and it's my favorite subject. I feel like antiworkers are to economics what antivaxxers are to biology. It sucks because they're both ideologies that push you away from the one thing that can help you. And the cost doesn't come right away. It comes later when you end up much poorer than the average person in society or you end up dying earlier than the average person in society.
