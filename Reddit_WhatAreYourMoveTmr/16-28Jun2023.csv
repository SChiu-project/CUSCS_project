*the circle is complete* My NVIDIA $425 calls were up 100% today and I didn‚Äôt sell, long $ROPE Wow NVDA down to levels not seen since 7 hours ago I just know there is some guy out there who went all in on NVDA and AMD calls before close and then took a nap ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) JPow speaks twice tomorrow. We already know what he thinks so it doesn‚Äôt matter. Thursday we‚Äôre going to continue to get higher jobless claims and Friday‚Äôs PCE number is gonna come in perfectly in line. SPY 445 is guaranteed After some soul searching (masturbating) I have found out everything will be okay I ordered chicken parm and got this dogshit https://imgur.com/a/YUBqAo6 Remember smoking in the boys room?

Movies are dead. Same old storyline. It‚Äôs just like recycling something over and over. Where is the creativity and new ideas. It‚Äôs literally a matrix ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31225) NVDA is going to pump back to 420 at open tomorrow. My puts told me Bears giving reasons why this shit should crash and burn fail to realize that no one can predict crashes, thats the point. Its so rare that Michael Furry does it one time and gets a movie made out of it But i just got my NVDA calls ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31225) Fuckers this is exactly why I always tell people to stay in cash at the end of the day! If u re up take ur profits and move on to the next trade! This nvidia shit gonna make people loose a lots of $ tomorrow I would lose purposely on the first round of squid games Saw too many homeless poors today, went all in puts How many pillows do you guys sleep with? 4 -5 here #Pro tip



Every time you make a great trade and hit big gains its because you're a great trader, when your plays go to zero its because of CriMe and FuCkErY Bears celebrating AH action after getting dragged around by their ankles all day ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) Today was just a small taste, tomorrow will be the real pump 1997

Bought puts at close idk if I‚Äôm just ballsy or regarded as hell Imma post the pix of the pizza i just simply don't see the bear case for SPY sub $470 So I studied this thread a lot. I just got back from giving a Blowjob behind a Wendy‚Äôs dumpster. What do I do now? Where‚Äôs the guy that was saying NVDA news was coming out after close today. We need to talk Wow, NVDA plummeting to levels unseen since \*checks notes\* 11:50 AM this morning pizza pic [https://imgur.com/a/XirXIVz](https://imgur.com/a/XirXIVz) It feels so good to sell your options intraday, have them close lower than you sold them for and have the market go the other way after hours.

Apes could have studied hard and been making $120/hr as Citadel Interns working for Ken in Miami, instead they went full regard and lost all their moneys now running on just fumes and conspiracies. On my second week working in investment banking got caught looking for trade ideas on this sub, so today I've been Goldman Sacked I ate too much peanut butter directly from the jar, with a spoon. futes have opened blood red at -.19%!!!  recession is imminent and we're all going to die I‚Äôm buying apple tomorrow tired of seeing it go up and up without me protip if you cry in the shower  you dont need to wipe your tears don't worry guys trade war is bullish ![img](emote|t5_2th52|18630) The shorter she cuts her hair the more hurt she is after the breakup I picked up a free breakfast Crunchwrap and had it for lunch today Cathy buys AMD yesterday lol.

/u/kirxan made a bet that NVDA would go to 333.0 within **1 month** when it was 377.995 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.

They are putting out worse and worse product, and their foray into politics hasn't been good considering a good portion of their consumer base doesn't like it. Disney Plus isn't profitable, and I'm skeptical of it's future prospects due to said worse product and their models... Direct to streaming only works if the products don't suck, and I'm hearing increasingly negative things about people's experiences at parks and resorts. Iger doesn't seem like a fix...

‚ÄúWhile the A800 and H800 are slower than the chips they replaced, they are still the most important technology powering AI research and development for China‚Äôs tech giants.

Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu, ByteDance and other Chinese groups placed additional orders for Nvidia chips when the generative AI wave exploded in China this year, according to two people familiar with the situation.‚Äù Is it wrong to feel like we are in another tech buble and that I should be worried?

/u/ryebread_10 made a bet that SPY would go to 427.38102 within **1 day** when it was 431.698 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.

Their record is now 2 wins and 10 losses I have to get up and go to the gym but I don‚Äôt want to An American Pulse poll says 80% of men would cheat on their spouse if they were 100% guaranteed not to get caught. Agree or Disagree? The fact that JPOW is speaking at market open tells me he'll be super neutral in his talk. Also unless we get a Q&A it'll just be a reason to pump. going to the real casinos in vegas this 4 day weekend, see you losers there QQQ return: Haha you cant beat me

Banks going down tomorrow Holy shit nvidia what happen  Shares of Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) slumped in the extended session Tuesday following a report that the Biden administration is considering a new ban of sales of AI chips to China. Late Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported the Commerce Department could further block sales of AI chips to China without obtaining a special license first. Nvidia shares fell after a 3.1% rise to close at $418.76, and AMD shares fell 2%, after a 2.7% gain in the regular session to close at $110.39. Both Nvidia and AMD have launched new AI chips this year. The ban would follow upon similar actions last year that threatened $400 million in Nvidia sales, but the company found a workaround in supplying a version of products that avoided the ban. At the close, Nvidia shares were up 187% in 2023, and AMD shares were up 70% for the year. in space  no body can hear you scream ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275) Keep calm and buy dip on NVDA at open üòÆ‚Äçüí® [deleted] Honestly can‚Äôt tell if the quality of things is generally shittier now and/or iv become an old grumpy man Did Biden save my tech puts?

She suddenly stopped and froze for a few moments, as her eyes couldn't believe what she was seeing. Harry pulled out of Ron in an unexpected hurry and stood straight. There he stood - naked, embarrassed, and still quite erect. Ron stood up immediately from being on his hands and knees, and covered himself with his hands.

Hermione's eyes changed from wide and horrified to a frown as she pointed toward Harry. ""Is that..."" her lips were pursing repeatedly, as they did not want to say the word she was about to say. ""POOP,"" she finally blurted out. ""On your... THING??!""

""Oh God,"" groaned Ron as he covered his face with his hands and turned his body toward the corner. Harry looked down and found what appeared to be a glob of chocolate pudding on the head of his member. ""I suppose it is,"" he stated softly.

""Well, I guess I should have taken the advice that my father wrote to me before he died.""

Hermione's dark brown eyes looked up from Harry's body and met his gaze in a combination of horror and anticipation of what he was about to say. Even Ron reluctantly peeked out from behind his hands.

""Always wear a condom,"" Harry said with a bit of a smile. They each stood looking at each other for what seemed like an eternity before bursting out into laughter.

I do wish I bought next week's puts, instead of this week's tho. Guh If AI is going to be such a game changer (not saying it wont), then wouldn't it benefit every single company in existence? It wouldn't just be the producers of AI, it would be an efficiency gainer for nearly everyone. A matter of fact, I believe that the AI race will be structured similar to the online streaming race where it was a ""race to the bottom"" pricing wise. Part of the reason I believe this is because this is often what happens with intangible products. It's possible that the consumers of AI will actually benefit from the technology more than the producers. If this is the case, why aren't we seeing this reflected in valuations? I think it's because this is a manic speculative bubble. 

It doesn't matter if AI is the future. The internet was the future in 2000 and it was a terrible time to buy related stocks. International trade was the future a few hundred years ago but that doesn't mean your ancestors should have FOMO'd into the East India company after it went parabolic. https://www.balenciaga.com/en-ca/paris-coffee-cup-black-809907444.html

Or were you referring to being the person buying shit positions off smart money (e.g. providing the liquidity for them to exit their positions)? That's just called *being a bagholder.*


Sick of all these pseudo-scientific arcane arbitrary acronyms/backronyms/jargon. ""Exit liquidity"" is not a thing! Fuck off! Futures crashing why The rumor is that Biden will ban more chip to China. That's probably why NVDA is down in AH but that's only a rumor so far.

As long NVDA is above 400$ in AH and no confirmed that the rumor is true tomorrow then I think NVDA will go up again tomorrow. NVDA giving back todays gains AH NVDA finally gonna get under $400 tomorrow We've got to hold on to what we got.

So who cares about a one off transaction, about 5% of a single quarter's revenue, NVDA stock is based on the next decade, and first chip ban already priced that in??

Last quarter, NVDA revenue was about 7 billion.   So as a first approximation the loss should be at least 5.5%.  

Then you have to figure what that 5.5% was expected to grow into over time, maybe 10-20% of revenues?  Higher?  There's only two countries with large social media / cloud data companies....US and China  (Alibaba, Tencent, Bidu).  Counter arg might be that the 5.5% was a one-time thing, maybe a pull forward even with China companies putting in orders as fast as they can expecting a potential ban.

Most 20 somethinngs don‚Äôt got 35k to swing. 

The median is better to look at and more real for most 20 somethings [data shown here](https://www.synchronybank.com/amp/blog/median-retirement-savings-by-age/) puts the median retirement savings for under 25‚Äôs at $1,800 or about a 20th of the average while 25-34‚Äôs are at a median of 14k, or less than half the average and likely weighed up by the 30-34 part of the bracket. If they broke the bracket down further to 25-29 if reckon the median would be just under $10k

So rest assured, most 20 somethings are just as a broke as you and aren‚Äôt balling out. It‚Äôs the Walton family‚Äôs grandkids skewing the averages No girlfriend or friends and live at moms.

Lost all my savings, will power and social skills prior to a bad injury that kept me bedridden for like a year. Uber depressed and also bought the top on LTC like a true degen with $200 and lost it all pre much. Which was a lot of money to me at the time. 

Just 2 years later i had $20k, was leaving a entry level sales gig for one that paid much more and in 2 more years time would more than triple that amont in investments, got back into shape and got my social skills back.

Oh, also somehow managed to sell LTC at the bottom before the 2020 pump to buy like at the time 4 more shares of CCL‚Ä¶ but at least i made some money on the CCL trade. Woulda made all
My money+gains back if i just held the LTC tho, but at least $200 wasn‚Äôt a lot of money to me anymore. Kim Kardashian, duh Have you heard of Tingus Pingus.

I'm bulking and eat about 5000 mg sodium a day (i know i love salty food) as long as I'm drinking at least 2 liters of water a day, I'm fine

Salt and MSG is not an issue unless you have underlying health issues could just be dehydration. could be genetics. the DV for sodium is kind of arbitrary, really depends on the individual. 

I‚Äôm not a doctor tho sir If this is serious, you should probably go to urgent care, a doctor, or an ER. Not ask WSB Drink some chloride to turn it into salt. It‚Äôs over, get your affairs in order. Drink lots of water.  If you start getting heart palpitations or pissing blood go to the ER.  As long as you‚Äôre healthy your kidneys will filter excess sodium out whats funny is that that lost rev wouldnt fucking matter because even their current one is too low for their current price if banned then more low end gpu like consumer 4090 is needed to make up the AI model

 $BIG making moves I literally have no NVDA position, just trying to figure out what level I want to SELL puts on it tomorrow. I feel like the strippers are gonna be under motivated. That or we getting over charged as a result. It‚Äôs better than nothing but fake money is easier to counterfeit than real money. I‚Äôd be interested to see how that system works. I remember the dancers being pissed off about the ‚Äúusher bucks‚Äù fake money usher brought to a strip club. I could see something like that happening again. Until the feds block that 3AM transaction to your plug that ain‚Äôt paid taxes in 10 years üòû Woah i agree it‚Äôs my thinking that with less strippers there will be more sex work. Why send her $200 for a lap dance when when I can send $40 for an hour. Think of all the chips we will have to ourselves. Plus they will just sell them at a premium to chyna anyway bro is exit liquidity and has no clue It works for me so üíÖüèª Right?

Maybe some punk bands but none of those get on tye radio. Maybe Dead Kennedys A rubber room with rats My analysis is about 60% bull/40% bear in here right now imagine staying in the hookup rat race for years trying to impress some shallow women with your sexual techniques only to realize that no one cares and you‚Äôre alone without a family. That was really detailed It‚Äôs definitely getting over 190 üôèüèæüôèüèæüôèüèæ I got some yesterday she sold at the bottom

Then Friday when it broke all time highs i started getting back in

I ended up with the following positions:

64x 182.5p July 21
4x 187.5p July 21

good luck to you sir -500 so far today yea bro its a bargain right now Go for it omg Ok, Macho Man. Beeeer, yeeeeeeea. Followed by doing stupid shit in your life. Your whole childhood.. just stop going to the same church bro. I word but I don‚Äôt clerg No I just don‚Äôt clergy very often potentially. this is probably the biggest tech based narrative since the dot.com bubble. I haven't put too much capital into it yet because of that. But, I'm diversified across the major players and will move the capital based on who makes that major leap in terms of a competitive advantage and we know how the end users will adopt it. 

I think its the most sensible long term move. Ride the collective uptrend, then shift higher percentage of the capital into the market leader when they become more clear. Same for quantum computing Nice cope brokie [deleted] ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259) Eat my ass and tickle my bear taint ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883) [deleted] I‚Äôll take your word for it, but to answer your post yes Ron shouldn‚Äôt be liable for another individual unwilling to pay student loans theoretically i can  come up with  like 475k down payment  but im still gonna get fucked on the  monthly payment Maybe you shouldn‚Äôt take financial advice from YouTube. watched your video.  This isn't the GFC, lending standards are much higher now.   People aren't defaulting.  Wages have increased due to inflation.  People want to keep their homes because they got low mortgage rates before Powell started raising and their housing prices have increased even as rates have risen.   They aren't underwater.  There is a shortage of housing, and those who have cash or higher wages (due to inflation) are the one's driving prices higher right now, and once rates come down again, everyone will be bidding prices up to new highs. That‚Äôs all subjective and depends on individual circumstances, real estate is a finite asset, and renting is also throwing money away I‚Äôm talking about the top 10%, not the bottom 10% (sorry if we had a mix up there) just don't over think it I sincerely doubt that‚Äôs something you‚Äôll ever be dealing with lol, so why are you worrying about hypothetical situations that you‚Äôll never be in? Idk if I could handle all that. WSB peen index. It‚Äôs high right now or something Haha nice, love skyrim flipping couches? nice. Never heard of that. I see free ones all the time on FB marketplace.

The crazy thing is, I had NVDA calls that I bought 30 minutes before close, was instantly down on them, recovered them to exactly a $0 loss and sold around 3:55pm. I almost held overnight, but decided slow and steady wins the race. I got charged like $7 in fees. Thank fuck 5000 shares deep @ $4.50 and I‚Äôm not leaving. Here with you sir.

Definitely. Just wanted to see if it would work... cheers! I‚Äôm not blaming jpow, they choose not to listen and got wrecked with poor investment decisions. The fuck did you eat I mean what‚Äôs the buy side catalyst? High interest rates, weakening consumer, sticky inflation, over bought market. Bulls had an argument in October when the market was ‚Äúoversold‚Äù, now they really don‚Äôt have a compelling case except ‚ÄúSToKs GoooOo BuurrRrrR‚Äù months?

dude I cashed out my tesla and nvidia puts yesterday

today I entered apple puts baby Not saying you‚Äôre wrong, but I‚Äôm saying timing this is impossible, and a fools errand.

You're supposed to only day trade options, not hold them long to avoid all those Greeks, theta, time value decay. that was you looking in the mirror at yourself homo. That's a really good point.

Maybe they‚Äôre mostly paying all cash though. Who knows. I check some houses near me and you can tell what they put down initially thanks to Zillow etc based off their equity and value at time of sale I‚Äôve seen 6 years of quite solid gains lol. My mortgage payment and tax and insurance bundles together are now the same as a nearby 1 bedroom apartment lol. And I gain pore equity each and every month and live in a massive place.

As long as your mom thinks you‚Äôre getting big that‚Äôs all that matters At the very least, back and bis, chest and tris, only *odd* thing I‚Äôll do is legs and shoulders together It's 3 major muscle groups, that's tough to hit in a single workout.  It's not bro science it's common sense, im not trying to put you down or insult you.

Even if you're skipping dead lifts you're at least doing some type of chest press, an overhead press and a row or pull down all on the same day?  Also I'm sure you're not doing just one workout for each muscle group.  I guarantee you're just going through the motions and not pushing yourself if you can hit those 3 muscle groups together in one day.  Push and pull is done commonly but to add shoulders in there with it....are you short on time and only going to the gym twice a week or something?  Or are you going easy and doing body parts twice a week?

Either way it's a bad split, shoulders doesn't belong in there. [deleted] Agreed. I'm thinking SPY up big while SEMIs tank.

I agree with what you're saying, but it doesn't change the systemic nature of debt cycles. Real estate is made of deteriorating material, just like a vehicle. 

The point of renting is to generate cash flow from your liability rather than just paying on it and hoping to sell after time appreciation.

I'm gonna keep interviewing just to learn more about the project but he didn't know that Yes, but I won‚Äôt; I promise I wish, but there‚Äôs no coming back here Thank you. It‚Äôs been fun Possibly I‚Äôm very much looking forward to becoming a boyfriend. Sometimes I have wet dreams about it Yeah they probably cashed out stock options and are paying all cash What makes you sure? I haven‚Äôt heard of that one. That definitely would‚Äôve came in handy a few years ago. There‚Äôs no conclusive evidence to that, and especially not in the doses I‚Äôm using Wasn‚Äôt my point I actually host a lot of stripper parties. My real point was the physical cash is a key part of the exchange. Make it rain and it motivates both sides. I‚Äôve seen dudes throw more money competing with other dudes than to impress the dancers. It also motivates the girls and indicates what sections are worth working. So if you take cash out it affects the entire process. My grandma says i‚Äôm handsome and buff ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883) I understand where you‚Äôre coming from and know the logic but ive tried various different splits over the years and i like the current split that im doing right now. Its not the same ol split that everyone else does. Its just really about what works best for you. I usually do back and chest together and recently added shoulder in there. I do see great results on my body GGIIIIIII JOEEEEEEEEEE I remember üò§ Crazy how time works Are you stupid ? Nowadays you can‚Äôt afford shit anymore. Old people just had life on easy mode is what I‚Äôm saying. Jesus Oh, I did not know that Stankest hoe But Q and stuff ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267) Because then I won‚Äôt be able to BS during the day while everyone else is working. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm still up now. The only thing on my itinerary tomorrow is it go to the gym lol. The trash aspect is because places are either over or under developed for their size. LA has a bunch of single family homes and cars. But if they had a bunch of skyscrapers and a super nice subway system, it would be much nicer. Much more of the landscape would be open for more people. But it‚Äôs too small for that and too big for the current infrastructure. It‚Äôs the worst of both worlds.

The same goes for rural America. No one develops water, cell service, internet service, etc. because it‚Äôs too underpopulated. Young people keep moving away leaving behind only dying boomers. They‚Äôre turning into ghost towns. If we just let people move where they want, people would spread out to the optimal location based on supply and demand. It‚Äôs nuts that people can‚Äôt afford rent at the same time that commercial real estate is in deep value territory. 

This is a broader secular problem in all developed countries. If we‚Äôre not careful, we‚Äôre going to turn into Japan. The biggest reason why China and India are supposed to become superpowers isn‚Äôt that they have big populations. It‚Äôs that the average age is much lower than in developed countries. That means more working age people taking care of fewer retirees. Enormous chunks of the US‚Äôs money is devoted to just keeping old people alive for as long as possible. Instead of forcing American millennials to do it on their own, why not bring in immigrants to bear some of the burden in exchange for citizenship? 20% of the young people in China are unemployed right now. Meanwhile, the US has twice as many jobs as workers. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|31226) Damn man, quite the convo.

I simply have a higher intelligence than you and can see through your attempts to mislead me. they didn't fail because loans went bad, they had treasuries mostly, they failed cause of duration risk on interest rates.  We're near the top of rates now, so that also isn't much of a factor going forward.  Banks tightening standards isn't really a problem for residential home buyers, plenty of buyers have good high paying jobs, and if they happen to default, the shortage of housing means the foreclosed home can fill its role as collateral. A vehicle is a deteriorating asset, unlike a home or real estate which is generally (historically) an appreciating asset.  I‚Äôm not sure what you are on about but assume you are priced out of the market right now due to rates? and that's why you're in your current situation Whenever man, you can take the elehator to the ground floor and see yourself out Fuck So yes, in your opinion, without China there's no growth for chip companies... I'm not mad at all. Making fun of you actually not bad,  what did you  buy it for i saw it lol I was looking at the same thing, picked up a few just for giggles.

Look at his past silver predictions. The guy makes some good points but his predictions, especially those about market crashes and precious metals are almost universally wrong.

> there is about 26 people with a claim to each ounce of physical silver out there.

This has been the case for around 50 years and nothing has changed. One day, it will break but what are the chances this happens this year?

I've studied this market about 10 years and all I can tell you is that it's the most disappointing thing ever. I'm not saying to ignore the sector, but if you have expectations like that, you're gonna be disappointed. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275) I‚Äôll take buffet and burry analysis over yours any day [deleted] Tell her your gay it worked for me but kinda backfired because she told other ppl then found out I was lying Ahhhhhh please no he doesn‚Äôt want to look üò± üëÄ ‚ùå Bro it's gonna be ok, you don't have to have a stroke LMAO I did myself take a 7 month pause/break from March 2022 to October 2022

Just from my expierence personally I saw major changes in my physique when I started treating shoulders like a major muscle group instead of a secondary one.  Having broad shoulders that stand out is a huge difference maker, as important as anything. lmfao calm tf down little guy, i  didnt come here to listen to your temper tantrum. Yeah the WW2, Korean war, and Vietnam war generations had it so easy idk bro being poor sounds kinda shitty ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) I understand, but just the thought of it, I've always been an amd guy since the early 90s After the atom bomb was invented that was the same strategy: prevent anyone else from figuring it out.

Yw Folks I'm not actually a business analyst making 60k a year üò≥ Nothin fat about me except my cock and my wallet How to tell a homie he's looking cute without r/sounding gay Calls on MySpace Ryan Cohen or Michael Burry is Executive Chairman of the plunge protection team? Now I know there won't be any short squeeze and bears are going to catch ligma waiting for the Fed pivot that will not happen. And tomorrow is going to be nofap Tuesday when the market takes a dump dump dump dump. This is not financial advice. Btw. NVDA back to 430 this week! Let's go! Europoors actually not dumping is crazy wow with putin scheduled to speak i bought 325 spy puts $432 for .11 cents a pop at 3:00 PM .  sold em for .75 cents each at 3:53.  initially down 2k then exploded for a solid 577% return.

This summer I invested $17,500 (six months salary and my entire life savings) into ornamental gourd futures, hoping to capitalize on this lucrative emerging industry. After watching a video about Vincent Kosuga and his monopoly on onions, I decided I'd try to do something similar with another vegetable. I did some research and found out many agricultural forecasters expected this year's gourd yield would be far smaller than the past, due to deteriorating soil conditions in central Mexico and a warmer-than-average spring. At first, demand soared around Halloween and prices skyrocketed, but the gourd bubble burst on November 12th. Unfortunately, the coronavirus caused a massive drop-off in demand due to fewer families decorating their tables for thanksgiving, and prices plummeted. I had invested early enough that I thought I would still be fine, but then on the morning of December 2nd, a new email in my inbox caused my stomach to turn into a pretzel. The massive gourd shipment from Argentina, scheduled for early March, had arrived. I was planning on selling off my futures right before this, in February, but this ruined everything. To top it off, the gourds in this shipment were absolutely gargantuan, some topping 4 pounds each, causing the price-per-pound to drop like an anchor into the range of 6 cents per pound. I am ruined.""

""Thank you for coming so quickly, Harry. I'm sure you must be quite curious as to why I summoned you here,"" Dumbledore said as he reached for something behind his desk.

""Of course, sir. Always happy to do my part,"" Harry replied as he watched Dumbledore with curiosity.

The old Headmaster emerged carrying a decorative throw pillow and slowly walked toward Harry and threw it behind him. With Harry's back turned, he secretly examined him the way one of his first-years might eye a new Nimbus 2000.

""Harry, the reason you're here is because I have a very special potion for you,"" Dumbledore said with a twinkle in his eye as he clasped his hands in front of him.
""We of course have numerous magic potions, but this one is made by muggles.""

Harry looked shocked. ""Yes, that's right,"" he continued. ""They call this one 'Rohypnol.' Have you ever heard of it?""

""No sir, I haven't,"" Harry said shaking his head and eyeing the ornate goblet the mysterious liquid was in.

""Oh, well I think you're going to like it,"" Dumbledore stated with a very kind smile, handing it over.

Harry eyed it momentarily then drank it gulp by gulp. ""It's delicious!,"" he exclaimed.

""Yes, well I thought you might enjoy it. You see, the taste is nothing special. Just some cotton candy flavored powder. But the effects... ahh, now that's where the magic is.""

Dumbledore raised his eyebrows and gazed at Harry amusedly.

""You won't remember a thing. Not even this very conversation.""

Harry looked at him quite quizzically, and was about to respond.. but all the sudden he felt quite tired. He fought the rush of dizziness that suddenly overtook him, but collapsed onto a pile of pillows.

Then a blurry Dumbledore stood over him and just before losing consciousness he heard, ""And now you're about to find out why they call me Headmaster."" bers LMAO ü§å BER FUK ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276) Everyone who bought the top congratulations üéâ.

Have a little common sense and Learn to take both sides and make money no matter what the market does. Warren Buffett lay on his deathbed, his once-vibrant eyes now clouded with the passage of time. He had amassed a vast fortune over the years, earning the moniker of the Oracle of Omaha. But as his final moments approached, he found himself reflecting on a plan he had kept secret from the world, a diabolical scheme that could reshape the global economy.

With great effort, Warren's bony fingers reached for a framed picture on his bedside table. It depicted a younger version of himself, smiling alongside his late wife, Susan. The memories of their life together flooded his mind, reminding him of the immense power and influence he had wielded throughout his illustrious career.

Warren had always been driven by a relentless pursuit of wealth and success. He had built a vast conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway, which had become a cornerstone of the financial world. However, his desire for an ultimate triumph, a final testament to his genius, had consumed him in recent years.

His plan had been simple but audacious. Warren had infused his entire wealth, worth billions, into a single stock: Apple (AAPL). As the largest individual shareholder, he knew that any significant movement in AAPL's value would send ripples throughout the stock market, impacting the broader indices. It was a high-stakes gamble that only a mastermind like Warren Buffett could conceive.

He had orchestrated a meticulous series of actions, building anticipation and creating an atmosphere of uncertainty. With each announcement of Berkshire Hathaway's increasing stake in Apple, the markets had reacted with a mixture of fascination and unease. Warren's plan was in motion, and the world was unknowingly becoming part of his grand design.

Now, lying on his deathbed, Warren knew it was time to unveil his ultimate triumph. With every breath he took, his body weakened, but his resolve remained unyielding. He had instructed his trusted advisors on the specifics of his plan. Upon his death, they would initiate the sell-off of all his AAPL shares, flooding the market with an unprecedented supply. The resulting panic and plummeting prices would send shockwaves through the global economy, dragging the world into the deepest recession it had ever experienced.

As he contemplated the consequences of his actions, Warren's mind was awash with conflicting emotions. On one hand, he reveled in the idea of his ultimate triumph, the pinnacle of his cunning and strategic brilliance. On the other, he questioned the morality of inflicting such suffering on countless individuals and families worldwide. The weight of his decision bore heavily on his conscience, even in his final moments.

With a deep sigh, Warren whispered to his attending nurse, ""Bring them in, please.""

A hushed silence filled the room as his closest advisors entered, their eyes filled with a mix of concern and anticipation. They knew the gravity of Warren's request and the tremendous responsibility entrusted to them.

As they gathered around his bed, Warren's voice grew weaker but his determination remained resolute. ""Sell everything,"" he rasped, his words carrying the weight of the world. ""Execute the plan. Unleash the storm.""

The room fell into an uneasy stillness as his advisors absorbed the magnitude of his final command. They knew that the repercussions would be far-reaching, but they also understood that they were participants in history‚Äîa history shaped by the genius and audacity of Warren Buffett.

Warren closed his eyes, his labored breathing growing shallow. The world outside his room continued to buzz with its daily routines, unaware of the cataclysmic storm that was about to be unleashed.

In Texas you have castle laws. 

If you travel to Chicago and kill a black man they are gonna say you came across state lines like rittenhouse all motivated to kill or something and you're screwed. Just avoid bad areas I mean if you carry the strap your probably going to kill someone. That‚Äôs just how shit works. 

That chick in Texas killed that Uber driver because she was carrying a strap. No. Learn how and when to use your gun.

Which is pretty much never. [removed] I was making fun of this a bit earlier, but I looked it up and I was right. The biggest concealed carry insurance company is one of the fastest growing companies in the U.S. It‚Äôs pure profit because the risk in people‚Äôs minds is huge, but the actual risk is tiny. This honestly is one of the best business models I‚Äôve ever seen. It‚Äôs a private company unfortunately otherwise I‚Äôd throw money at it. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267) bulls were saying the same pre-market yesterday ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) CLOWN ü´µü´µü´µ What are you even trying to say What‚Äôs his name?

Worthless pos mouse SPY has unlimited upside and DIS experienced the highest amount of growth they could have for their sphere, any more upside it has will be slow and minimal DIS has lots of uncertainty that is why it has been failing.

We love new and original content here on WSB.

We have no tolerance for basic templated memes, reposts from the front page, or boomer memes.

Yes, this can be a little subjective at times, but we want to show you the best WSB has to offer!

If you need some guidance, don't hesitate to reach out to modmail and we'll give you some pointers!

A few tips though!

‚Ä¢ Don't just submit a chart of the current price. Come on. Google only costs $5 per search. (wait, you guys are searching for free?)

‚Ä¢ Reaction gifs are fucking lame. Put that shit in a comment, no one wants to look at your face in real life anyways so why are you making a thread about it.

‚Ä¢ Don't repost stuff. All of us are terminally online, how dare you try and make us laugh with an image posted somewhere else. Jokes aside, we don't want to beat a joke to death, so give us some fresh OC and we'll be a lot cheerier. Please take all unbabying talk to another subreddit. No one wants r/wallstreetbets to become a political hellhole.

I normally always buy spx that‚Äôs the wierd part but made $$ last time with SPY so just went with it again does it really always end badly ?  If you never go crazy and play 4-5k options with one hour till market closes for spy or any stock on a friday, the loss is capped at 4-5k and the gain is potentially and realistically 500% plus.  If I can afford to lose a few 4-5k hits now and again is the danger that I eventually place a 50k bet or even the 4-5k bets are dangerous? All of it. What‚Äôs the play? Tech is dead as‚Ä¶.

Microsoft rarely gives guidance. But they're in court right now due to the FTC blocking the Microsoft-Activision deal. This memo came out in the trial. Nadella said that they're aiming to get to $500 billion in annual revenue by 2030. Today, they're at $207 billion. The crazy part is that he wrote this in 2022 before ChatGPT took off. The point is that their internal estimates of growth are way higher than what they've been telling Wall Street. It means IT is in a massive bubble and he's dishing out next Bull Market hopium already whilst expecting the crash.

If I buy calls or shares your puts will moon Nah you good! It was a good tip The credit is going to be less than the collateral that you have to put up to sell it since the collateral will be enough to cover the max loss of the spread. You will have less money to spend on longs than you did before you sold it. Am I taking crazy pills?

Edit: I think I see what you‚Äôre saying, you‚Äôre saying offset the cost of a bull spread by selling a bear spread. Saying you‚Äôre ‚Äúfinancing‚Äù it that way doesn‚Äôt make sense though because up front you‚Äôll have less cash, not more. It sounds like you‚Äôre saying you can sell the spread and use that cash if you don‚Äôt have any, but you already have to have more than enough cash to cover the spread you sold. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258) You didn't say you were floating in a pool.

"" Unless you select otherwise, simulated stop-limit orders in stocks will only be triggered during regular NYSE trading hours (i.e., 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. EST, Monday to Friday). IB's default trigger methodology also contains additional conditions which can vary depending on the type of product trade "" Also, unless you really know what you're doing a stop limit triggering after hours can be fatal.  The default iIbelieve again is to convert it to a market order...but a market order after hours can wipe you out due to extreme bidask spreads.  Also, extreme trades go through all the time after hours, spreads are huge in illiquid stock, is your trigger at bid, ask, mark, etc..., u need to understand all this.

Walmart takes 10 minutes to walk inside, I don't have that kind of time. You're blind then. Oct 10th SPY 360. Close yesterday, 432. From Oct to now all we've been doing is higher highs and higher lows. We're in a massive up channel.

19.5% change to the upside. The official definition of a bear or bull market is a 20% change. 

We're there, cuck. Ah the degenerate type. As expected. I‚Äôm gonna get real fomo if they do lol Their hidden commissions are smaller than the places that charge regular commissions (65 cents per contract) and hidden commissions (bid-ask spreads combined with payment for order flow). And even though their subscription program is only $5 a month, I don't subscribe to it üòÇ 

I feel bad for them because their plan was to shock the brokerage industry with zero commissions. They started a hardcore race to the bottom that seriously hurt Schwab, TDA, ETrade, and Fidelity. I don't know about Fidelity since it's private, but Schwab stock tanked 30% in two days and stayed down during the regional bank crisis. And TDA and ETrade struggled until they were bought out by Schwab and Morgan Stanley respectively. 

But then right as Robinhood was blowing up, they were forced to turn off the buy button. And even though it wasn't their fault, they were blamed for it by their users, who are the ""least experienced"" (i.e., stupidest) traders in America. That killed their growth for no reason. Lmao, the funniest thing about the poorest investors is that they're the least experienced/knowledgeable so they need the most hand holding too. No billionaire hedge fund manager needs customer support to explain how a margin call works. But whatever, it's Robinhood's mistake for going after retail investors, and now they're bearing the brunt of the pain. It's that whole 80/20 thing except they are going for the 80% of people that represent 20% of sales. Good for us, not so good for them when it comes to making money off of us.

They got rid of the happy hour during Covid, and during the last couple years when prices went crazy, I'd ask the people working there if they were bringing it back they would smugly respond, ""No"" and say it in a tone like I was some type of peasant who was beneath them.

Just went back on Thursday for the first time in about a year, and the same woman was working the hostess stand. I asked if happy hour was back, and she said very quietly and timidly, ""Yeah, we brought happy hour back last week"".

Even put it in a paper trade to watch it but didn't have money to open a position cuz I'd already opened one on SOFI (F\*ck Me).

I had a tight thesis for it to shoot up since it was getting added to the S&P 500 and I had timed the option play for when it was going to be added to the index.

Option went up 180% day one then crashed down the next day and stayed red for a week. Then it went up to over 1000% just a few days before expiry.

Had a 10 bagger in my hands... but I'm currently unemployed and just started trading so there will be other plays.

There are a number of reasons why your drug dealer may be out of cocaine. One possibility is that they simply cannot get their hands on enough cocaine to meet the demand from all of their customers. Another possibility is that they are selling other drugs instead, such as methamphetamine or heroin, which may be more profitable or easier to obtain than cocaine. Finally, it is also possible that your drug dealer has been arrested and is no longer able to sell any drugs at all. Get your wisdom teeth pulled if you haven‚Äôt already.

Lol who goes to Twitter for actual information? That‚Äôs what Wikipedia, universities, and real news sites are for. Twitter is for wild opinions, up to the minute rumors, and cutthroat arguments. It always was whether you realized it or not. 

One of the reasons people came to Reddit back in the day was because the US was super religious and it was a huge taboo to criticize Christianity. Meanwhile, Reddit had /r/atheism was a default sub. This website first started to decline when they took it down. They started prioritizing ad dollars and making people feel good over real unfiltered discussion. Twitter feels like the Reddit of old.

The error that most people in this sub make is that when you enter a trade, it‚Äôs not a single coin flip. It‚Äôs a continuous series of coin flips. And the past result doesn‚Äôt dictate the next one. Thinking it does is called the gambler‚Äôs fallacy. Every millisecond you hold cash, stock, options, etc. is another coin flip. This continuous compounding is why you need to use the natural log e when modeling out compounding in stock/option investing (unlike in simplified bond investing.) It‚Äôs the basis for the Black-Scholes equation. Bruh, Delta devaluing skymiles like crazy.

I have experience with pharmaceuticals Currently, it doesn‚Äôt affect American publicly traded companies.

They are under so many Western sanctions, it is entirely irrelevant. The only possibility is the sanctions are lifted, and that would be bullish, as our companies could return to take their money.

The United States hasn‚Äôt done business with or in Russia for 3 years.

Russia is a zombie country with no effect on Western markets, at the moment. i mean technically the bank owns it still  but i've paid off like 1/3rd of the mortgage. thanks for the  kind words bro Yeah this dude is feeling down and has a mortgage. I sleep in a twin bed in my parents‚Äô house ü§£

but the main difference is that in europe people work in order to live while in the US people live in order to work

once you've lived in both places, you will definitely understand the meaning of that sentence yes opportunitues to get in debt and to continuously compare yourself to others who have better cars and bigger houses, since you know, there's nothing in the US besides showing off to your friends and peers Okay you get me one time good br≈ìza üòÇü§ù I got them a few months out, I think they will be ok There is a reason oil has gone down since Ukraine happened Well I had a cell phone super young as well, but email is a weird one, I used AIM, so I had a email obv , but I didn‚Äôt really email people too much He‚Äôs one of the best to do ever do it. There‚Äôs a huge difference at that scale. Warren Buffett has said it would be easy for him to do 100% YoY with a million dollar port. These guys move the market. Their advice doesn‚Äôt apply to us.

To toot my own horn here, I‚Äôm a pretty smart guy. My boomer family savings account is up 72% in the last year and 75% YTD. My entire strategy is ‚Äúwhich 4-6 companies do I truly believe will be here in 20 years‚Äù and then find a good entry. My current darling is DE but I‚Äôm up 200% on NVDA, 40% on AAPL, and 37% on MSFT. If the economy isn‚Äôt growing over the next 20 years money won‚Äôt matter. Any company that exists today that‚Äôs still around in 20 years will have grown for 20 years.

Italian girls are super slutty as well but they try to hide it I‚Äôm rock hard for DE right now. I don‚Äôt think 4x over the next 6-8 years is unreasonable.

They‚Äôre considered an industrial trading at a 12-13 PE hovering around a 110-120B cap. Years of lawmakers shooting down right to repair has set them up, AND THEYVE BEEN PIVOTING TOWARDS, an annually recurring revenue model similar to the pivot ADBE made in the early 2010s when they effectively invented SaaS. So on that alone they begin to look more like a tech company than an industrial and I challenge you to name one other 100B profitable tech company. I was gonna add some shit about food being essential to humanity but honestly profitable 100B tech is a unicorn today.

Now add the AI revolution to the ag tech company that‚Äôs spent a few years proving it‚Äôs agility.

I‚Äôm buying DE every paycheck below $600.

But also, gotta keep the gambling account. TSLA 0DTEs make it move every time.

FWIW I‚Äôve been buying DE since February and it just turned green in the last few weeks, currently up 7%. As crazy as this may sound, I‚Äôm REALLY looking at BTC. I was soooooooo close buying 2 coins at $17k ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I feel like it‚Äôs gonna really take off It just depends on how much you‚Äôre willing to lose and how long you‚Äôre willing to hold. I had a fairly extensive crypto port before 2018 /2019 and sold everything on the way back down. I built it back up and sold a little early on the way to 63. I‚Äôve been slowly building it back up since, absolutely buying below 20k.

The rules change when you stop trying to flip a quick bagger but obviously trading is more fun than investing.

Today's bullish move was just a sigh of relief from Powell. We have quarter boomer rebalancing for all of the indexes. Mainly stocks WAY overperformed bonds so pensions and other massive funds are going to be selling stocks and buying bonds. BUT! That's also a chance for a lot of the money sitting in the sidelines to jump into the uptrend. So it will be a battle. I expect though for smart money to let this shit sell off so they can get a cheap af price and trap retail shorts after the rebalancing. Had a feeling today's pump was sus af.

I‚Äôll charge it all on the cards until BK. Never going to recover anyway f the market and my life Wtf happened to futes ?!?
 
No ... Please noooooo Japan inflation marginally lower than expected - may force the BoJ to tighten their ultra loose monetary policy

BoE hiked 50bps after core cpi went up

JPow and every voting fomc member that spoke this week so far have been hawkish on hikes 

Today tech went up and looks like investors may be fleeing back into safe havens, like t bills and mega caps. I'm going to buy the dip tomorrow.

I guess if they're ITM you can exercise whatever is unsold. am I missing something? I likely won't ever buy 900 contracts at a time but wondering if anyone has ever run into liquidity issues with daily options close to the bell.

I‚Äôm surprised this website still exist tbh. 

I went on there for cocks and instead I found creeps. Night ruined. S·ª± Bae vs Cathie ‚ÄúJesus‚Äù Wood Biggest contributing factors: huge progress so far on inflation during recovery, acknowledgement of delayed effects of rate hike, unaffordable home prices and large individual debt and Fed going with a pause. 

I‚Äôm feeling a minimal hikes to satisfy congress. Probably increase in capital reserve requirements. Don‚Äôt forget the influence that these large banks have and their resilience after the recent failures. Short term dip will cause people to call it a recession. Fear will lead to back pedaling.

We will likely be looking at rate cuts within 12 months. This will be done to act as a boon to industry so they can point to lowered inflation after the hikes, economic prosperity and job creation through recovery period.

Looking at the trend, we never actually left the bear market. This was an uptick. The bull market is coming and it will be in full force by the end of 2024.

Investing stock during dip and calls for 2025 will make you feel like the geniuses you already think you are. [deleted] Musk vs Zuck cage match ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)

I'm talking way, way back,  earlier this month in June.

And then, I decided to buy a house and so I sold all my positions and bought a house, the closing is in July.

I'm so glad the market is down today, because I don't have any positions, so let it burn, I say.

There is no moral to this story, I just bought a house.  CONGRATULATIONS is how you respond.  It is my second home, the first one is in Ukraine, but I haven't been to that one in awhile.  

So lets just say I have an american house now.   Is it the best time to buy real estate?

Well are any wars coming up?   No...well perfect...good time to buy.  

OK, my moves tomorrow are none, of course, in a quiet period until the house closes.

Your moves tomorrow - theta gang, imho, sell some short dated call options. Even though im a bull, LMAO at the guy who bought my calls at EOD today The rally appears to be over & the market is beginning to move down out of the pump it has been in all year.

Idk. Puts on TSLA We‚Äôre fucking doomed scoob Tank Seng gonna save my puts??? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31226) The BoJ won't ever raise rates. They're perma at -0.10%. It's their philosophy bc they've wasted soo much time in a deflationary environment. BoJ wants to incentivize growth to combat inflation and weaker currency allow for more exports. US dollar is going to get more buying power as result, strong dollar is terrible for international software companies like MSFT. So if this goes too far it can be damaging bc a lot of people had Yen as safe haven asset, a lot of hedging is at risk. We got a new hire at work and bro is so weird I‚Äôm about to put my 2 weeks in Bulls should be renamed the Titanic as they ignore warnings and head full steam ahead into an ice field of negative economic metrics. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640) So my 435p good for Tom?

Lesson learned just trust TAN MAGA !! Big NVDA rally tmrw. To avoid ~~pump & dumps~~  huge gains, we only allow stocks above a $500MM market cap. Root for Zuck in the cage match against Elon. Finally Tesla puts might pay off as Zuck robotically dispatches Elon. Plus Andrew Tate wants to train Elon... Never thought I'd root for Zuck at anything,  but here we are.

Bulls finally going to get their cocky attitude shoved right in their mouth [removed] ALL BULLS WILL BE IN SLAUGHTER HOUSE TOMORROW...üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ [deleted] People were fools to think inflation was defeated by any means. Most world economies haven't even begun to experience the effects of the insane central bank policy of the last decade (and particularly during COVID). It was almost like basic economics went completely out the window. 

Now the consequences are coming and they will be devastating as central banks have to choose between out of control inflation or vaporizing their economies. They won't have a choice but to do the latter eventually.

And don't think for a second that we're doing any better here. Core CPI has hardly moved from its peak last year. All it will take is an energy spike which can happen quickly and without warning and we could be very quickly back to high single digits or even low double digits. 

TLDR; bulls are absolute morons. There is 0 bullish case whether you look at the inflation problem, a global quantitative tightening beginning, yield curves inverted to an extent only seen before major market crashes and recessions, and out of control manic market valuations. And that's just scraping the surface of problems. Bulls have the memory of a goldfish. A couple slightly small things go right and they think we're starting another 10 year bull market. There will be lots of pain to come. 

TLDR 2; SPY under 200 before end of 2024. Bull r fuk.

ok Meeseeks you left your underwear at my house This is a fair warning to all bulls, the market is crashing tomorrow. Mark my words.

Bulls think the last 13 years of easy monetary policy means we'll have another decade bull market just like oceangate assumed because they had a few successful missions, they didn't have to do their due diligence or have adequate safety precautions in place. 

Bulls will be humming along going their merry way, when all of a sudden their ports are completely decimated without warning.

Oooh it‚Äôs gonna be so juicy Someone understands! Cute (mis)quote, but back here in reality...

The first part of the quotation (""If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered"") has not been found anywhere in Thomas Jefferson's writings, to Albert Gallatin or otherwise. It is identified as spurious, and the words ""inflation"" and ""deflation"" are not documented until after Jefferson's lifetime.

The second part of the quotation (""I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies"") is a slight misquotation of a statement Jefferson made in a letter to John Taylor in 1816. He wrote, ""And I sincerely believe with you, that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies; & that the principle of spending money to be paid by posterity, under the name of funding, is but swindling futurity on a large scale""

The third part of this quotation (""The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs"") may be a misquotation of Jefferson's comment to John Wayles Eppes in 1813, ""Bank-paper must be suppressed, and the circulating medium must be restored to the nation to whom it belongs.""

This first known occurrence in print of the spurious first part with the two other quotations is in 1948, although the spurious portion actually appears after the two other quotations Damn I wanted this to be real: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bank-shot-2/ Sounds cute but not doable, as most of the cute ideas. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31226) Cat ears > Wednesday 20 bucks is 20 bucks Did you do it?

Whether it could do 4000m is a different story (design parameters for engineering vs advertised and tested limits).   They didn't get it certified past 1300m because they don't sell that product to people who typically go past 1300m 
  
But, there was a lot of completely questionable design decisions with that deathtrap.

_In August 1974 Yellen killed her opponent, Marsha Langston, an up and coming kickboxer that was participating in her first Kumite. Rather than show sympathy for her deceased opponent, Yellen pointed menacingly at another fighter in the competition, Frank Dukes, and said ""You are next."" Yellen was defeated by Dukes in the final round of the competition but her life was spared by Dukes. Yellen retired from fighting after the 1974 Kumite._ Tweet her. If I know Janet she won‚Äôt turn down a good bare knuckle brawl. Let‚Äôs make it happen on the undercard. Given the still uncertain economic outlook and possibilty of recession the risk is skewed to the upside.

Vigilant market makers, those vivacious virtuosos of valuation, vehemently vowing to vanquish the villainous void of vexing vacillation, voicing the vigor of vitality in the viscera of the economy.

Visibly, they volley, veneering the volatility, a virtuoso of vested interest, valiantly veering the volume of value from vanishing into the vortex of vanity. They vigilantly vie with vices of vulnerability, vindicating the veneer of venture capital, making it a vista of voluminous victory.

Vociferously they veto the vile void, vaingloriously voicing the virtue of vibrancy over the vacuous vagary of volatility. A vivifying venture of vivid valor, validating the virtues of volatility management, thus vanquishing the villainous volatility from vaporizing the value.

In this vaudeville of variables, they, verily, vivisect the volatility, voicing the victory of value over vapid vices. Veritably, a vivacious valiant valor! The versatile vindicators, vociferously vowing for vogue in the vortex of stock market's volatility. A vortex vexingly kept from vanishing, not by some vague vanity, but by the vigilant valor of our verbose market makers!

How many times we been thru this That was me Bull market confirmed It will have to correct at some point you logically think‚Ä¶ Got bad news for you. The S&P 500 bounced today off the middle of the current upward channel. At the EMA 8 low. It was an engulfing bullish candle at lower volume with positive OBV divergence. RSI on the 1Y is reset to the place it was at when it ran from 430. 430 was a key bull level, having walked up two levels on price and volume association. Market breadth is catching up at the long term even with a pullback of very short term market breadth, that means that the laggards are moving up more than the runners are moving down.

To break out of the upward channel by the end of the week, SPY has to break below 425. You've got about $11 to go before anyone can talk about breaking down out of the current uptrend. And to beat the 1Y trend like you're saying, you need to break down below the 0.50 now that we're officially in technical bull market footing before algorithms reverse. That's 410. Which you also need to break below the SMMA 200 and EMA 50, which are both also critical bull/bear algorithmic dividers.

You're hoping for a technical reversal here just because of a pullback, that's like betting your house on getting a royal flush. (And that's true regardless of how it turns out. You've got a lot to work through on the market to actually break to a downtrend.)

r/WallStreetBets is ultimately a community about making money through trading, and our conversations should shift around that.

Politics are fundamentally intertwined with making money, and political actions almost always have an impact on financial markets.

Still, we need to make sure that when we have these discussions, we're explicitly calling out the financial impacts of the politics we're discussing. Otherwise, the conversation can very easily veer off into flamewars and boring, unproductive, discussion.

Here's an example of a political comment that doesn't offer any value:

* ""I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. What a fucking idiot""

Now compare it to this:

* ""I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. It threatens the profit margins of oil companies because they will need to expand their OpEx. I have calls on Shell that are going to get decimated at open.""

The latter is significantly more interesting and offers a great jumping point into market related discussion.

Put succinctly: If you choose to start or engage in arguments about libtards or Nazis instead of making fun of their bad SPY long then you're in the wrong place and we'll show you the door.

If you're not sure if your content is political, it probably is, and there's probably a better way to post it without making things weird.

BoJ wants to incentivize growth to combat inflation and weaker currency allow for more exports. US dollar is going to get more buying power as result. But if this goes too far it can be damaging bc a lot of people had Yen as safe haven asset, a lot of hedging is at risk.

Regarded Selling off is a necessary part of break outs. As the price reaches levels it hasn‚Äôt been to in months you have sellers show up and drop the price. As the price starts reversing anyone who has profits from buying lower starts taking profits bc they see the price pausing and reversing. If it‚Äôs really in an uptrend it won‚Äôt have many red days and if it does they won‚Äôt take a lot off the price because as the price comes down buyers are willing to step in and buy the stock ‚Äúat a discount.‚Äù Not only that, big market makers and funds need large amounts of liquidity to buy shares. What ends up happening is the price gets bid down to a recent ‚Äúsupport‚Äù level and breaks below it, thousands of stop orders get triggered and the funds gobble up the shares and fuel gets added to the coming breakout when all the sellers get cleared out and available shares start drying up.

Once you let investors run wild it's almost impossible to bring things back to normal its called the wealth effect

when peoples houses and stonks start going up in value they feel richer and go back to spending like drunken sailors which basically pushes inflation back up

hence why you see every central bank going back to hiking now, canada and BOE already cancelled their ""rate pause"" and now the fed has signalled we are getting at least 2 more hikes, which btw will do jack shit at this point

back in february when the markets started this ""rate pause"" rally i fukken called it that the fed would regret not nipping it in the bud, now here we are with the fed having to hike yet again WAY past where they needed to hike if they weren't so regarded, its so easy to predict this shit at this point whats funny here is that he basically DID pull a paul volcker with last years rate hikes, and then completely fumbled right at the finish line by ignoring assets rallying again Eat my dongus you fuckin nerd.

The company managing the tanker said Friday that the people on board ‚Äúwere very hesitant to receive any assistance, and at any attempt of approach the boat started to maneuver away.‚Äù

Eastern Mediterranean Maritime Limited said in a statement that the people on the trawler were eventually persuaded to accept supplies.

Experts said maritime law obligated Greek authorities to attempt a rescue.

They definitely ‚Äúhad a duty to start rescue procedures‚Äù given the condition of the vessel, said Professor Erik R√∏s√¶g of the University of Oslo‚Äôs Institute of Private Law. He said a refusal of assistance can be overruled if deemed unreasonable, as it appeared to have been on Wednesday.

Flavio Di Giacomo of the Mediterranean office of the U.N. migration agency IOM tweeted that all migrant boats should be considered dangerous and rescued immediately because ‚Äúeven when they appear to have no problems, in a few minutes they can sink.‚Äù

Rescuers pulled 104 survivors from the water and later recovered 78 bodies but have not located any more since late Wednesday. The Greek coast guard said the search-and-rescue operation would continue beyond the standard 72 hours.‚Äù

Seems Greece did what they could for survivors. Did they not try hard enough? I am failing to fall asleep üò≠ Just keep your money in BIG companies .. at least 1 T like NVDA Not really.

Read the SEC filing. They raised $300M via a raise that began Aug 4th, 2022 (completed before Q1). They will raise an additional 400M in the coming months (likely after launch or after they get on a roll with commercial service). There was also an 8K filing after hours with Virgin Galactic employees exercise stock options at market price. Why would they exercise stock options if launch wasn't a catalyst?

I'm holding 20K in $4, $5, and $6 calls currently plus shares and buying more. Cost average is $4.30. Launch confirmed for Thurs morning. Already taken 10k in profits on calls. I like my chances.

No. See below ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882) Wrong again bear, I‚Äôm full of cum and cauliflower wings You ever heard of a bear market rally? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31249) They‚Äôll get a bump w rescheduling and safe act talks as the election heats up/happens‚Ä¶.

I‚Äôm a huge YouTube fan, so I‚Äôve been watching Mr Beast for a long time (I think when he had only 4-5 million subscribers?). Chris at the beginning of Jimmys YouTuber career had awesome camera presence and really brought a lot of the older videos to life. He was always the manly one in the group too, so that‚Äôs why his transition is really odd to me. What he‚Äôs doing now seems a lot like attention seeking behavior, so I can agree he‚Äôs that way now. I wouldn‚Äôt agree back when they first started tho. When is earnings Nice 

I have thousand @ $3.32 

I'm holding long term too. I was thinking about setting a stop limit at $5.75 just in case something crazy happens. I bought 7/7 7c today. They're cheap and I'm fine if they go to zero Nice. I was super good in high school, could‚Äôve played in college but not for D1 so not worth it.

FFS i got long dated shits too but with vol collapsing this shit is rough Hmmm AAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!! Probably. The bear case is basically a recession. Will that happen it is to early to tell. Do you have any idea how lagged the hike effects are? 2 more hikes is a worst case move. Even the Fed doesn't know exactly how the lagged effects will crop up and that's why they're skipping - to get a measure of with a good month for the market to chew on the rate as is. From what I'm seeing in retail and at the grocery stores prices are dropping significantly. Home values are peaking or have already. The big thing I think will limit an inventory run is all the debt accrued over the last 3 years to help things float will need repaying and most will want to settle it sooner than later. I'd be willing to bet inflation won't be accelerating to YoY increases until q2 2024. I certainly don't see it alarming anyone in July. If you think a tiny hike to 5% is anything like what Volcker did, you have some reading to do. Volcker raised the rate to 21.5% and utterly slammed the brakes on the economy with no mercy. Unemployment quickly rose to over 10%. Soft landing was not a goal. JPow is not an economist so he doesn‚Äôt have the confidence to make those kinds of moves.

They are printing money and keeping interest rates low in order to try and encourage economic activity. However, there is only so much they can do and eventually the market will have to correct itself. Trillion dollar question [deleted] then don't be average

couple thoughts about your rant - high interest rates earn you more money on your savings - it doesn't squeeze your budget, it helps.  if its squeezing your budget it tells me you borrow on credit cards.

it doesn't increase your mortgage one iota, because you got a fixed interest rate, right?  

Don't supplement your income with credit cards, don't buy a home that you can't pay for

oh but shitz so crazy because ppl need the simplest understanding of money to make it now, no covid checks, so whens the next bailout?   

shit aint crazy today, but someday we might not be at 100% employment, so wake the fuk up I agree.  You choose you're reaction, your in control of that.

The stupid shit we do to act tough and feel cool in front of our peers. Honestly I don‚Äôt think the Lawyer guy was necessarily doing it for validation. I think it was just kind of a dork who had appreciation for something and he kind of wanted to show others something that he found really interesting. But yeah what a way to go. I don‚Äôt care how strong or impressive glass panels are in my mind you don‚Äôt tempt fate that way lol. It is certainly true that many people seem to believe that nothing bad can happen to them, even when they are engaging in risky behavior. This often leads to disastrous consequences, as the recent stock market crash has shown. Happens man Farewell, goodbye,  good luck. It‚Äôs an expression of good wishes not necessarily the after hours sometimes can get weird since there‚Äôs just less activity. either two things will happen:

1) triggers a sell off, gives you a chance to get out

2) triggers interest, you get fuk

not fa Hard to catch today I bought mine like 5 minutes after market open when it was down bad at least you went to the gym boss you will win tomorrow Google it regard A random unpredictable event that tanks shit, something catastrophic such as a terrorist attack or major scandal or some shit like that. Market is run on mania rn so the only thing stopping momentum are hopes and dreams, so as long as nobody gets scared it will continue to rally up. Basically, the black swan is like the hat man, only instead of hovering over your bed, what it does is fly around the room going ""CAW! CAW! CAW! I'm a swan, but I think I'm a raven! CAW! CAW! CAW!"" and then the market crashes or something. I did some metrics, im running the last HEDT skylake-x and found no difference in my current setup.

I was targeting power savings for the most part ... and I found turning off one of my monitors was actually a bigger deal than anything.


Strangely enough I popped in a artic liquid freezer II, upgrading from an old EVGA CLC and man that thing can keep the i9-10980xe cool.

The EVGA just didnt work Big doo doo in markets CPI high in japan. Hang seng died, was a whole thing Just don't want you to think they're selling oranges or something over there Tsla Nvda mid July You're right, anything other than going up every day is a reversal at this point. The market has been on an upward trend for so long that any slight dip is seen as a sign of impending doom. However, I'm not worried about it because I know that the overall trend is still upwards and eventually the market will rebound. They‚Äôre gonna be under pressure that‚Äôs for sure but let‚Äôs hope they don‚Äôt hold out for a hero and turn into Major Tom. Nah, Virgin has always been a safe investment so long as it‚Äôs not hot air balloons or trains or record companies.

Whaaaat news.??. 338.79 I'm sorry, but you are wrong. Flairs on this sub are given to people who have made significant contributions or who have been active for a long period of time. To counteract your hyperbole and single bear case?

1) CPI has come down significantly (rate of increase, not deflation.)

2) Fed rate is at/near peak

3) recession is looking less likely

4) housing starts are recovering

5) spending and borrowing is still healthy


I'm not in the business of predicting the future, however, June/July CPI is likely going to be the beginning of the end. Keep crying your warnings of doom, just buy a call or two to hedge some of your impending losses. Just fine because I know how to sell at a profit yesterday. As in not in a growth phase with a 39 P/E ratio. That's insane lol

It matters when recession/downturns hit. There's always a valuation reset. I wouldn't be surprised to see this at a P/E of 8 to 12 at some point in the next decade. Pe what‚Äôs that? You aren't the center of everyone's universe.  I'm not gonna tell you how to process whatever happened between you and her.

I think it‚Äôs pretty dismissive to throw out like 40 years of litigation on hundreds of corporate fraud issues including environmental pollution, roundup, etc, just because you disagree with his team‚Äôs research that vaccines are responsible for the uptick in autism.

Then that qualifies you as ""good"" but not ""super good"". Um, bro I'm nutting in your tessybear why are you talking about stonks? [deleted] [deleted] Dame ur a natural I almost like this more ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260) Lucky us! 2 rich dorks fighting for all of us to go to Vegas and make or lose some money off of some embarrassed tech billionaire‚Äôs loss Stay strong gay and proud bear brother ‚úä recession will happen, as usual its a question of ""when"", next year? in 5 years? who the hell knows Look at it this way, are the hikes that big of a deal? Have they personally made things worse for you?

I can't speak for everyone but these hikes have been amazing for anyone who has some money in the bank, a guaranteed 5% is beautiful for risk averse people.

Imagine having 2 million in the bank and being able to get a risk free $100k a year, that's basically an easy retirement.

The only people hurting are the poor's, but that isn't exactly new and they don't have money to spend in the economy anyways.

With stonks going up AND with rates this high, essentially everyone is a winner, bears and bulls are both making money. You want blood in the street if you want inflation to go down and stay down, and I ain't seeing any more bleeding going on. you are right about volcker raising rates higher, but gotta remember that he started off from a high base, so he only doubled the rates so to speak

powell took them from 0 to 5, more than 5xing them, not to mention the economy is much higher leveraged so the hikes sting even harder

powell basically destroyed the CRE market and caused some regional bank implosions with these hikes, and stonks/housing markets were blowing up too, he screwed up now by letting a rally take place and a new AI bubble to form Just cause you sharpie nips on it before slipping it doesnt make it no homo. Doubtful I love slutty animals A variety of people made me better, and consistent long term partners also made me better. A person having a lot of sexual partners doesn‚Äôt mean anything, some Midwest boring ass mentality. Ahh you'll learn someday This works on mobile? On Apollo app?

I have multicore enhancement off Shit i have a very large position dependent on aapl price tm lol There is a subreddit somewhere that you can find a guy dude with strange interests to entertain this.

Alpha Very discrete dumping, it even seems it has stabilized somehow Last nvda if you dont mind ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31225) yes, i am a significant contributor Where is my flair then you bch 1. Core CPI has not...just because oil and natural gas tanked doesn't mean shit

2. Says you. They're hiking two more times and if inflation surprises to the upside, rates are going much higher

3. Strongly disagree

4. For now, way too early to say

5. No it's not. The spending and borrowing completely blew out of control. If you want to know why the inflation is consistent around the globe, start here So is NVDA valued at $1 trillion with $9 billion in revenue. They make 8x less than DIS. It‚Äôll take them 10 years to make what DIS does them talking so fuckin loud is a BIG YIKES...... i dont mind different languages. but when you're shouting then thats fuckin different...just STFU the whole neighborhood dont want to hear that shit ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787) Not sure what you mean by `counter-position` limit orders here. Oh hot love üçÜ Heard he might have said Ligma too. Why not. They say 2024 could be profitable. This could moon if the execution is right. There trucks appear to be popping up everywhere as well. And they have a deal to supply to amazon. This is a risky/calculated buy. I‚Äôm just mad cause I make bets that stocks will move 7% in a day and always lose üòû Haha I don't think so.

Not even sure how you ended up on that tangent. Wher my ber buddy?? except i'm not an ape. so that doesn't make sense. but pretty sure you also don't know what irony means anyway.

I've been doing this since 2019, started in commodities, then during the COVID crash moved on to options. Anyways, good luck on your journey brother Never from me Thanks. I had a gut feeling about them early last year when I did my research. The trapped ion patent looks promising compared to the competition. Ugh bro I‚Äôve got to get in shape tbh.

The poor are definitely losing out here, as they always do when the economy is doing well. But that's just how it is, and there's nothing we can really do about it. I think you are right, some people just need to get laid more. A wide range of sexual partners is promiscuity. Guess what that promotes? Disloyalty There‚Äôs a reason why STDs exist, because it actually is filthy to rub your crotch inside dozens upon dozens of human beings. If we didn‚Äôt have modern medicine the majority of folks in today‚Äôs society would be dead or walking with gonnorhea

Either due to a losing argument or they just like being little trolls and get a rise out of someone when they find a typo.  It's just a typo, if someone corrects it, let it ride.  You don't have time for that petty nonsense, you have money to lose.

Also, my (your/you're)'s were switched up in my last comment.  I'll leave it to you to decide if you caught it and ignored it or just missed it.

Good luck out there.  Don't let the sons of bitches bring you down! [deleted] Niche stuff is a lot easier than mainstream events Mayweather was like 50-0 trained for decades on end. Zuck has been doing this for literal months not years. He‚Äôs got nothing. Also just bjj? He‚Äôs gotta get Elon on the ground to be useful. Give Elon 6 weeks to train and he brakes that      little shit I'm not mad, I'm disappointed. This hurts you more than it hurts me. \*pulls out belt\* Bullish on giant rabbits and political prisoners So no he wasn't impeached. Most expirations are. The quarterly expiration on /ES is American style but the weeklies and monthly expirations are all Euro. SPAN margin also gives you much more leverage... There are also tax advantages to futures. Everything suddenly makes sense now‚Ä¶ Sooooo it will turn it POSITIVE for tomorrow?.? $4, $5, $6, calls expiring 7/28, 8/18 and Oct 2023. I have some $4.50 and $5.50 calls too. $7 and $8 Oct calls, etc Not really no. I kept that on, Silicon looks good on mine so im not too worried.

The i9 i have is known to be one of the worst things to cool, and I didnt want to do a custom loop.

I did measurements tuning off half the core going from 18 to 9, which still leaves me with 18 total from 32 and literally there was a 5W difference at idle. At load around 65W peak difference


These processors are pretty efficienty mostly ..... considering they are not mac books Then you should probably be doing your own research instead of asking WSB to do it for you Yes lol I guess they are kinda gay‚Ä¶ I have a couple CALL options open myself sooo im NOT hating IF it POPS, buuuuut ive oretty much already chucked up that money as a LOSS...üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ 427.01 Yes, I'd agree NVDA is even crazier than Disney So you're holding long futures. Instead of setting a stop to auto-sell you at a loss, just buy a synthetic short to hedge your outright. Ligma?

Don't worry; we are aware you are an ex-ape, with a grudge. Absolutely.

Please DO NOT announce to the sub when you are going to go masturbate. This has been a reoccurring issue, and I'm not sure why some people have such under developed social skills that they think that a sub full of mostly male strangers would need to know that. No one is going to be impressed and give you a high five (especially considering where that hand has been)

Sincerely,
My balls I‚Äôm telling you all right now. It‚Äôs actually insane that any of you think this is flipping over in a bull market so easily I would be next level pissed at myself if I ( unknowingly ) paid $250,000 to die at the bottom of the ocean. Don't be like me guys:

The situation you're describing, where equity indices like the NASDAQ, S&P 500, and Dow Jones are down but the VIX (Volatility Index) also decreases, can be attributed to a few scenarios:

1. Market Expectation: The VIX measures the market's expectation of future volatility, not the current or past volatility. So, a drop in VIX suggests that investors expect the market to be less volatile in the future, even though prices might be falling at the moment.

2. Decrease in Uncertainty: Sometimes, a decrease in the VIX can reflect a decrease in uncertainty, even when markets are down. For instance, if there's been a build-up to an event (like a major economic announcement) and then the event happens, markets might drop on the news, but the VIX might also drop because the uncertainty surrounding the event has been resolved.

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260) I‚Äôm just happy Spce didn‚Äôt tank more. Tomorrow back to the moon for a bit. Have late July $90 BABA calls. Cut my losses or do I have a chance? Alcoa down 2% AH I‚Äôve noticed two groups of people. 

Those who think AI is here, is straight out of the movies, will take our jobs, fuck our sexual partners in front of us, and force us all behind Wendy‚Äôs dumpsters at the thousands of Metaverse locations that will open up. 

Then there‚Äôs those who think AI is total bullshit because Chat GPT can make mistakes. All VR is just Zucc‚Äôs Metaverse and is lame and has no use besides games. AR is also lame and useless. Remember the Metaverse hype haha it‚Äôs basically dead now‚Äù 

Both of these groups are idiots. 

Group A are just morons who get massively overhyped about things they don‚Äôt understand. See: Crypto, UFOs

Group B are also morons, potentially dumber morons because they don‚Äôt seem to understand that technology progresses over time. 

When every Big Tech company under the sun got hype for the concept of a Metaverse, saying it was worth billions on billions, they weren‚Äôt talking about Zuckerberg‚Äôs dumb shit Wii Resort. 

The idea of the Metaverse is the ubiquitous presence of AI, Autonomous tech, VR, AR, etc. all interweaved together in our society. 

The web, but present, a layer of tech overlayed on the world. That‚Äôs ‚Äúthe Metaverse‚Äù dumbasses. It‚Äôs like 20 years away. Tops. Anybody got insight into why kb isn‚Äôt skyrocketing on earnings? Just noticed the sub ticked up to 14 million degenerates.....Whoa. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882) So inflation will be 3% in the July CPI. What the fuck? im gonna cry that dude who fell off the boat and got eaten by a shark on liveleaks was an advertisement for shark week. WOW You know I love these ladies

You know I make them crazy So if you have a degree you can work for NVIDIA and sell shares at an all time high with work awarded free options? I hate being a grunt at the bottom I want some. I‚Äôm surprised u/Mathguy100 still has money to buy calls Sold my TSLA, I think we are going to go back down some because of more rate hikes, then im buying back in ü§ûüèΩ Poor people getting fcked on car loans and home mortgages, bullish for stocks, change my mind Breed up!

It‚Äôs just been panic to the upside and drip to the downside So we rally from QE and 0% rates in 20-21 and then dump because of high rates and QT in 22, then we rip in 23 because of AI? We won‚Äôt be able to pump when they cut next if we are at ATH  Initial claims tomorrow

My name is Benny and I'm currently enrolled at Stanford for Biomedical Engineering. Four of my classmates and I started a company called Ment(AI)l which has a mission to democratize mental health detection. The company's product is called FreeDoc - it's based off sourced AI software that is designed to ask clinical questions and creates a mental health profile and offer sound recommendations. The AI uses the DSM-5 (latest) and programmed examples to create the profile and recommendations. We already have a working prototype with 5500 trials and over 8800 test hours.

We're seeing great success and we already have quite a few people interested in taking this project public. Given this IPO environment, that makes us very excited!

The ask:     

We have the AI just about 95% optimized, but we've been struggling to find participants who can elicit a sub-75 IQ diagnosis.  We figure there is some bias as some participants don't answer everything honestly with us looking over their shoulders.  We can force the machine to output the profile, but we would rather be certain. Given WSB's user distribution and IQ distribution, it would be great if a even a couple dozen of your type could hop on the Beta app for us?  We're offering a Biggie Bag for anyone who can spare 15 minutes.     

Thank you!     
Benny In all honesty, I could survive this submarine fiasco. I have never been stuck in a situation I couldn‚Äôt escape. I‚Äôm resourceful and know how to keep my cool. I could figure out a way to survive if I was on it with those other people. Tesla calls let‚Äôs go to 300 üëç Most americans actually are of german/irish descent than they are straight english. It explains why we aren't as cucked as canada or england, who carry 100% inbred anglo-saxon cuck genes. 

Also, it's why you'll still find a decent sizeable minority of hot bitches in USA, unlike england where 95% of the women are ugly fat whales with TERRIBLE teeth ![img](emote|t5_2th52|2306)![img](emote|t5_2th52|31225)![img](emote|t5_2th52|2306) I lost -1k on tesla calls the very first week of January and ever since I just cannot breakeven.

When someone refers to something as 3-sigma, they are saying that it falls outside the 99.7% confidence interval. Put plainly, they are saying it is the 0.3% outlier within a population set.

Let's take a penis for instance - specifically the length measurement. A 3 Sigma Penis could be a 13"" mega dong, but it could also (equally likely) be a 0.4"" micro penis so thin that when you blow it, it whistles like a piece of grass.

That's right. A 3 Sigma Penis could be so small that it would be borderline invisible against an unsuitable light source. Let's pray for all the 3 Sigma Penis out there. They need it. Be sure to support anyone who comes out as 3 Sigma. üôè Last Bool r devastate 430 by Friday? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787) **SPX**: +0.8%

I hate it when assholes have to chime in with a ""but what about these other people who are more important. That's what really matters."" They're doing that now with the submarine people and saying ""what about all the refugees?"" They did the same stupid shit when the Notre Dame burned down...""but what about all the forests and reefs being destroyed?""

Like how dumb are you? Nobody is saying that stuff isn't important too, but using another tragedy or issue to leverage your own as more important makes you a total dick. They are separate issues and caring about one, doesn't mean you don't care about the others or are saying other issues (often very marginally related) aren't important Submarine people are now with Osama Bin Laden.

Damn. Should have doubled down on calls. futes collapsing LMAO ü§å Haha everyone expecting this market to V back once again. Maybe it will. Just keep in mind that stock returns after a yield curve inversion tend to be absolute shit. Recession is always bad for earnings, and it will translate into major valuation haircuts. We could fall 15-20% from here. The selling signal is unemployement numbers, and they tend to start spiking on average 12 months after the inversion. We are at 9-10 months now. Almost there The amount of you tards who don't understand the mechanics of why TSLA mooned this past month is astounding.

Some people stayed by the plane hoping for rescue, others left to fend for themselves and rescue themselves.

It was very hard to locate even in the Everglades due to the thick trees. Also shit tech in 1990‚Äôs.

They managed to find the wreck just in time to find the last sole survivor. As they were coming by helicopter to come down to rescue him‚Ä¶. A alligator came from nowhere and ate him. 

Ultimately, everyone was killed by predators.

Tree fiddy Here‚Äôs the bear case:
1) inflation is either sticky or it‚Äôs coming down hard.
2) if sticky, Fed will continue to hike beyond market expectations - so 6+%
3) if inflation really is dropping that fast, this goes with the other indicators suggesting recession is on the horizon Everyone shits on Cramer, but he‚Äôs actually been right far more than the bearrorists. He said March 16th ‚Äúshort this nasdaq and invite me to your funeral.‚Äù

Capitulated buls on a downvoting stampede VIX Am I the only one here who is massively green in BTC?? Downvoting poor is back [removed] I live in North Seattle about 25 min south of Everett, WA.

Earlier this year I was dating this bangin Korean chick who lived there and was a hardcore kite sailer and would wake up and go down to the port by the naval base on coldass days at 6 in the morning with a wetsuit on because the wind is so good there

One time I went with her and got my ass kicked and almost drowned, then we went to some hipster brewery at the dock because I needed a drink

I noted the brewery was in this sort of complex thing and wandered down the street while I waited for her to change out of her suit and put makeup on and shit

I noticed at the ass end of the building there was some shitty sign that said ""OceanGate"" that was green and blue and I was positive the place was a weed store at first, just seemed branded like one

I thought I might buy some bud so I got a little closer and realized it was some oceanic shit which I was super over and was about to walk away before noticing they had some weird high school science contest spaceship-like contraption under a corrugated roof next to a shitty motor boat behind a fence that didn't look that secure but said ""KEEP OUT"" and some shit about being on camera

I wonder what that thing under the roof behind the fence was

I've been trying to understand all the ups and downs, but it's quite overwhelming. One moment, a company's stock is soaring, and the next, it's plummeting without any apparent reason. It's hard for me to make sense of it all and figure out where to invest my hard-earned money. I wish there was a simple guide or a trustworthy source that could help me navigate this confusing world of stocks and investments. It's clear to me that I need to educate myself more about the stock market if I want to make informed decisions.

Im gonna go jerk off before I start. im strokin rn Who cares about the money. It's a sunk cost You‚Äôve hit rock bottom. imagine being so rich where you literally have everything you could ever need and want (100x over) and have done pretty much everything there is to do on the planet in the way of travelling and recreation that you just keep pushing the boundaries of things to do. so any novel thing that comes up you jump on, even if it's risky.

i imagine that's how it is to be filthy rich. you start feeling invincible. if paying everyone off to get your way and living in absolute opulence hasn't already made you feel that way.

also reminds me of that series ""squid game"" where the rich got their kicks out of pitting humans against each other and watching them crack.

in conclusion, being too rich probably isn't a good thing. life bores you and nothing has value anymore. even human lives. Should've held the puts like I did it was overbought asf.

Lots of people constantly think they have to understand a reason for the market to do something for it to make sense. 100% of those people should stop trading, because they will die poor after being constantly wrong and surprised by the market's absolute and perfect ability to do shit that they don't think it should.

Just easier to either buy calls‚Ä¶or wait and try and buy calls on a dip / bounce. 

I‚Äôve done some puts before, I always feel like I‚Äôm one violent relief bounce away from getting blown out. Also the stock market goes up‚Ä¶over half the time‚Ä¶can‚Äôt find the stats but I feel like I have read that in multiple places.

I mean look at the 5Y chart, not offer do you see a line like that and the market just takes it without any retreat. Idk don‚Äôt listen to me tho I‚Äôm broke. It just hit its ath yesterday Here is an honest answer from someone who actually makes money with options (daily):

What you're doing in this case is actual gambling. You have maybe a 50% chance of being right. Start looking into actual options strategies instead of guessing, which is all you're doing. AMD is a much more predictable play right now, for example, and there are other things like MACD, AO, candlesticks, that you can use to further increase your chances. There are actual strategies with 80%+ probability of profit.

Instead of just ""I think we're in an AI bubble"" like everyone else has been saying off and on, and always get burned. Yup, they have huge bags. They're gonna unload on retail so hard they'll need depression meds Elmer Fudd over here I‚Äôm gonna tell him to put a sock in it Ehh I'll concede by 10am tmmr. So far it looks like a toss up. Let's say I put deez nuts in your mouth.

As for credit cards, Visa is the most prevalent in the U.S followed by Amex.  But supposedly Amex is pretty safe.  That leaves Mastercard and Visa.  Mastercard has most of its customer base in Canada, which to be fair has alot of economic uncertainty in the future.  They also trade at a much higher PE than the other cards, so maybe more downside there? too poor Lab-grown meat could theoretically be different because it‚Äôs actual meat instead of a plant-based substitute.

Otherwise that wouldn't be the case with [oceangate.com](http://oceangate.com) Unemployment numbers tend to remain as low as they were before the inversion. Right now they are at 3.7%. that's super low still, but before that they are at 3.4%, even lower. Typically tho you see initial jobless claims start to rise substantially before unemployment picks up, as the economy becomes more volatile, and we are seeing that play out exactly like before past recessions. Because it's not lmao. It's only an indicator of tight financial conditions, not a full proof predictor of market returns. Financial conditions for the economy can remain tight for a long time before they start having an effect. Normally it takes a year, a lot can happen in a year. Also some market participants aren't there for the long haul, they're there for short term speculating and playing hype, like AI. Others see tight financial conditions and as a result go long defensives, like tech mega-caps, which are nearly 100% responsible for this bounce. Also you'd be surprised how many believe in a soft-landing, and sustained low unemployment numbers only confirm their bias. Now when unemployment spikes, they'll come around. Got fucked on those. Lost about 600k?  Did pick up 4k shares of TSLA at 120 tho so all is well üò≥ ![img](emote|t5_2th52|29637) Luckily, it's not in an account I can Yolo with.

do with that information what you will Some of the best engineers I know have no degree. Traditional companies are uptight but tech bros only care about capabilities.

Take  your PTO man, enjoy a funny movie or read a good book and have a nice meal,  maybe sit in the yard and  just take in nature If you tell me you work for Aetna and you're based in the Philippines, I truly apologize for calling you a F\*ck-stick.

I'm glad to see that my money is working for me even when I'm not actively thinking about it. As for the cash inflow, every little bit helps and it's nice to know that my investments are starting to pay off.

I was wrong to assume that everyone is as wealthy and successful as me. Please forgive me for my ignorance. I got it bro, he‚Äôs a broke pussy You're going to need something to remember me by when you realize I'm one of the few people here actually making money lmao Hahahahaha they‚Äôre dead bro These people are so easy to anger ü§£ I was homeschooled.

Please, please try again That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm doing college now I‚Äôll be honest, I haven‚Äôt been in long. Going on three years now, not long. But i do enjoy it, I know eventually it‚Äôll get to me, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm setting my future up now. Yeah, I remember learning about that shit and found it convoluted.  Basically, if there are caps we‚Äôre in an ice age.  There have been 5 ice ages.  They can go to 100 mil yrs I think.  We‚Äôre about 3 mil into this one, the 5th. But there are interglacials , or mini ice ages, that cycle in between at about 15- 30,000  yrs on avg.  We could be entering the next cold period, but it‚Äôs said human activity will push it back‚Ä¶. Who knows.  I got a kick from ur your ‚Äúbiological market correction‚Äù line.  Probably so true.  I‚Äôm gonna use that. I thought I nailed it r/overemployed is the real winner Yup you should know it a lot of regards use the phrase on here in relation to stocks I did that already to show her this steel pipe when she put that shit on

Had to let her know it was full approval I‚Äôm holding only up like 10% just fluctuating 10-20% past few days. You sound like you have a lot in it üò≥ Bruh, every single day QQQ has a deep red day and it seems like the market is finally rotating to other sectors, the next day qqq has a FACE RIPPER while everything else lags. LMAO, this shits ridiculous. Thanks I will enjoy nature maybe even the beach But what about trust fund kids? Ty! 

I might just stay in sales too. Money‚Äôs already good as is in my current company esp if i pursue management and i love the work. We shall see.

Only a fool would hold TSLA calls. Imma go down because I‚Äôm brave You're good man.  Just giving you shit.  Get as much done as you can while in and don't forget about the disability.  Document everything. Gaping? Oooooofffff did you give her dad eyes? it's still my fun account, but the second i see my money disappear, I instantly start thinking about the shit I could have done and bought with that money that I lost

my bigger account I have sind 5000 amazon shares in it and I just di coveted calls on that one Yeah it is getting annoying. The rotations aren‚Äôt longer than one day lmao. Decent drill today. As expected, could be a decent correction for qqq and soxx. Not a crash like dumb bears say, but 5% minimum could be in the cards. 

I‚Äôll continue buying the dip. Puts for my hedge actually sort of printed lol. At least I buy them at a good time unlike bears the entire melt up this past month.

Because I grew up went into the real world and only now do I spend a lot of time online because I developed health conditions Bro I said 5p you fucking regard Hey it‚Äôs all good For sure man, guessing you were in? Yup raw Probably. Some ""I'm not mad. I'm just disappointed"" I‚Äôve made and loss 6 figures plenty of times so kinda numb to it now but I‚Äôm working on facing the reality of the money and not make high risk trades and stick to a set amount now You're right, it is getting annoying. The rotations aren't longer than one day and that's just not enough for me. I need more excitement in my life. And you're also right about the correction - it could be a good opportunity to make some money if we see a 5% dip or more in the market. Logically QQQ should drill at least 5%, but i dunno bruh. 4 out of 5 days were red, and these bear cucks couldn't even drill more than 2% on the Qs.

I'm not bullish on the Qs, but I'm not betting there will be much of a correction.

Even that cuck Cem Karsan just tweeted today that bears are fucked, that they had their chance, and they blew it, and so he covered his short, and is once again pushing his thesis of blow off top down the road.

I'll give him credit, he called for weakness after opex, he was kinda right, and if he says the decline is too muted and we'll rip higher, he's probably right.

Everyone and their fucking dog would love a 5% correction, which is why those cucks won't even get that. This week has been the lowest volume week in a while, and red almost every day, but barely made a dent. Smells like a bear trap. AAPL call OI is insane for the near future. It's telling you that ppl are DESPERATE AS FUCK to buy any dip. This is setting up for another squeeze.

This week was very healthy. It shook out weak hands and is putting a floor in the market.

What you just sent me shows that we are still a long way from rolling over. They covered a bit of their short, but i'd like to see positioning get full long before we correct decently. More upside is coming. Also, dumbfuck hedge funds have been net sellers all this month, 1 trillion dollars of shorts added past 2 weeks alone. Bears are fucked. I'm 27 now, so, not really. Mom Oh Jesus child shut the fuck up King pog, I was in the Navy, lol.  My brother and a few close friends from high school joined the Army, all airborne infantry with the 82nd.  I just went under the ocean for a few months at a time.  I was pretty busy and didn't do school while I was in.  Regret it as there was time, I just didn't see it at the time.  It's good to do it, use your youth to your advantage ![img](emote|t5_2th52|29637) Sending thoughts and prayers king ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260) yeah on January 3rd 2022 i made and cashed out 75k with tesla calls thanks to car delivery figures.

I then managed to get back in too fast and lost 75k within 3  weeks always in January

that one really pisses me off We will see. I‚Äôm not bearish, but I do think we could drill or consolidate more. Soxx has already drilled around 6% and it tends to be a leading indicator of qqq due to heavy tech/semi presence. Qqq has drilled already 2% from last weeks close of 370 and 3% if u factor in the intra day high of 372 ish. 

It‚Äôs a bull market, so obviously the red days in compilation won‚Äôt amount to much and it‚Äôll take a long time to do anything meaningful. It took us a month to drill 6-7% from the feb top. Shit was reversed in a week and a half. Staircase down elevator up. 

I see breadth on the nyse went from overbought to negative. Usually corrections don‚Äôt end until we get oversold there in some degree. Qqq also lost the 10 DMA today for the first time since April. This almost guarantees that we will test the 20 DMA at around 358 or so. 

If qqq somehow closes below the 20 DMA in which is likely to be the 358-360 range as that shit rises every day, we don‚Äôt have any real support until the 50 DMA. Soxx already lost the 20 DMA today. 

I‚Äôm open minded if we bounce off the 20 DMA and retake the 10 DMA and start getting past high 360‚Äôs. But if we don‚Äôt, we likely see further downside to the low 350‚Äôs and possibly 340‚Äôs on qqq imo. 

I‚Äôm still buying the dip every red day, but I am not ready to hammer calls yet. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs an all clear sign for that. All these retail idiots are too ducking bullish and probably bought the short term top last week. 

Too many calls out there and positioning is extremely long with sentiment positive asf. We need some short term pain to fuck these idiots and get rid of the weak sided longs. Fear and greed just got out of extreme greed today. I‚Äôd like that to cool off a bit more. 

In the long run, this correction will be a bear trap and something that should be bought. I just won‚Äôt buy calls yet because timing is crucial and idiots probably bought at 370 last week and r bag holding. 

Bears are obviously fucked. No one‚Äôs denying that. But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unreasonable based on what happened this week to think that we could have more downside before next leg up. Could also be painful consolidation like in April. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|flip_out)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|table_flip) Well you are the pervert I better shut up before k get molested ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883) Nice man. I doubt it, but we will see. The bear market has trained you and many others to think a correction is a normal occurrence every 2 months. Nobody is extremely long, hedge funds have been net sellers every single day, that is fintwit propaganda. Extremely net long is when that positioning you showed me flips to long. Consolidation is more likely imo. Seasonally we are about to enter the strongest part of the year. zerohedge has been telling everybody to fade this rally since 4200, they've been riding michael hartnetts dick, everything they've said has been bullshit lol. im speaking about the general market. we are very far away from what is considered a bubble. we haven't even hit ATH, so there is no way you can call this a bubble. im just saying that we've been red almost every single day, and it's been such a pathetic sell off that bears have still gotten gaped as vix has declined so their puts still get destroyed. they'll be in a shit ton more pain next week when we moon hard as fuck ü§£ü§£ Oh im not saying we are in a bubble. I was just saying if we continue this pace of qqq rising 20% every month and a half and staying extremely overbought by historical measures, the only other time that happened was the tech bubble.

I just think the move just happened too fast and needs to consolidate a bit before going higher. But either way im not max short like idiot bears, so Im okay even if we moon higher. 

Just don‚Äôt think the odds favor us mooning hard asf after the recent run up but could he wrong. Im positioned for the upside with LETF‚Äôs but not ready to slam calls yet. That‚Äôs my only point. 

Bears decrying this as a crash or celebrating are fucking idiots and will get gaped for sure. Are there still people who are actually believe this is a bEaR mArKeT rALLy? I can understand a tactical swing on puts, but going big on them is fucking stupid. 

Put gains can get wiped out so quickly in this market. I remember after frc went under we dumped to 310 on qqq. All the dumb bears celebrated and got gaped to 323 in 3 days lmao i first want to see that dumbfuck arrogant shit-for-brains jedi_ant blown up. once he blows up, we will finally get a decent ~8% correction"

* Then you hear about how stupidly built this submarine is (ackshually it's a *submersible.*)
* Then you see pictures of the sub and learn details about their situation. It's pure nightmare fuel. In many ways, the best case scenario is if they were crushed and killed immediately.

Crazy thing is the billionaire Hamish Harding didn‚Äôt do much of anything noteworthy in terms of charity or helping those in need. I searched all over the web and only found he did stuff to raise awareness for malaria but no donations. 

This is why we should thrive to give even at our lowest moments. People remember those around you if they are hungry feed them, uplift others and it will come back. Some kid unboxing Legos makes more money than 95% of this sub.  Y'all need to stop trading and start hustling.  Sell pictures of your feet, start a trading YouTube channel your win rate doesn't matter, donate plasma, start a dog walking business then hire immigrants to walk the dogs, tune pianos using your ears then train the dog walking immigrants to do it, door dash and include a discount code to your feet pics Patreon, sell any and all vacant land, etc.

Being poor is dumb.  I just gave you the motivation to grind your way to Bel Air.  My name is Gary B. Stop and think to yourself: Is TSLA really worth $4200 per share?

When someone refers to something as 3-sigma, they are saying that it falls outside the 99.7% confidence interval. Put plainly, they are saying it is the 0.3% outlier within a population set.

Let's take a penis for instance - specifically the length measurement. A 3 Sigma Penis could be a 13"" mega dong, but it could also (equally likely) be a 0.4"" micro penis so thin that when you blow it, it whistles like a piece of grass.

That's right. A 3 Sigma Penis could be so small that it would be borderline invisible against an unsuitable light source. Let's pray for all the 3 Sigma Penis out there. They need it. Be sure to support anyone who comes out as 3 Sigma. üôè To anyone who bought FDX calls:

Price when added $3,000 and the price now is $100 How is the rise in NVDA possible without any pullbacks? I feel like the market is due for a pullback, it got too high in too short amount of time, that being said I‚Äôm all in TQQQ What the hell do you regards spend on each month that has your monthly spendings up 3-4k (not including mortgage) Is it expected to be dump tmr if corns ripping like crazy ? Man I never thought I‚Äôd say this but I miss high school. Sold TSLA calls at the close, shoulda held them fackers I‚Äôm so confused.

Their record is 0 wins and 4 losses. Dayum bro What‚Äôs that price I saved more money when i only made 70k /yr than at my 6 figure job now. Lifestyle costs catch up quick when moving to higher end cities. Most ppl dont understand that but youre fine Nah don‚Äôt trip about them king üëë you‚Äôre doing plenty well if you only pay 1k in rent. These regards probably pay like 3.5k on a mortgage and then gamble the rest of their take home so they end up with 0 savings. We have very clever way to save money like we pack our lunch. We all live in Kansas, of course. Life is not a competition of who‚Äôs richer. You do you. Mean while I‚Äôll be over here sipping on a glass of Domaine Leroy Chambertin Grand Cru If you're not making 100k your ability to buy a house, wife, and kids is close to 0% in most parts of the US. Why? Because 100k is not even enough in most places. A lot of average cities have houses starting at 500k. Interest will be 8%.

If you can afford that where you live, you are doing just fine. If you can't, it would be better to shed your delusions now rather than later.

As someone who started on the same salary as you, it took a few years for me to wake the fuck up.

And remember, that attractive people don't chose to pack up and live in Kansas. They move to the big cities. Wife & I I make 400k.  Still poor. Relatively speaking to Oahu where we live. We all have jobs and budget and also make solid W‚Äôs in the market time to time. Some of us actually trade for a living.

Your brain can have a lot of experiences with low blood constriction. Your dick won‚Äôt work right either so L citrulline would help combat the constriction. 

Watermelon naturally produces L citrulline and the pump from L citrulline is intoxicating. 

I would recommend no adds at the gym only pre workout with L citrulline. Have a meal Then take the addy.

IMO that‚Äôs much safer long term.

He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peek and he was browsing Zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.

That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.

Personally I own a total of 3 Logitech wireless keyboard and mice combos and for the $20-$30 I pay for them it‚Äôs some high quality shit. Other brands have them beat in the high end category but I think if they launched some new products they could easily compete with Corsair and the likes for their gaming lineup. Of course they have other products too.. Which exchange? Not sure the majority of future profits will always lose in this market unless you know what's next Gotta watch the spreads, but otherwise it‚Äôs good.

I‚Äôm not going to do it much, but it‚Äôs nice to have the option to trade in case something crazy happens in the middle of the night. Also, it has a gorgeous UI with a different color scheme so you know it‚Äôs the overnight session. I can trade ETFs and futes all night. There isn‚Äôt as much volume. This is exactly the kind of thing that I would expect from a company like OceanGate.

Hypothetically yeah markets would rip if he did a 180 and said those potential rate hikes were no longer on the plate and instead rate cuts were. But, again, there is a .000000000000000000001% chance that he says that tomorrow or anytime soon. 
Economics is an imperfect science and as such you cannot flip flop on policy. The fed will (and for the sake of our economy) stay the data-driven policy and continually evaluate whether to implement further rate hikes, for how long, and when to begin easing. Your right, but him speaking about the economy and re stating what he said and becoming even more hawkish can stop this ‚Äújpow bluffing‚Äù bull run and send reality down the market spine.

Then you can tell girls you own a condo, lock one down, produce even more wealth on a dual income and move to a nicer home in a less regardedly priced state when you‚Äôre both ready probably for less than you bought the 1 br shitdo for.

And hell, if the options thing works out(again it won‚Äôt, but fun to pretend you‚Äôll do something more with it than produce some C-tier loss porn), you may end up getting way way more out of it.

And ya bro! I have to keep my sluts in line It will operate on fundamentals when things start to fall apart. They haven‚Äôt fallen apart yet.

I'm only serious about trading on WSB, otherwise I'm amusing myself. I said that cause it‚Äôs true. I will fuck all of y‚Äôall‚Äôs moms. You‚Äôre just capping üß¢ Yeah technically. It‚Äôs unlikely though. Well with most stocks. It‚Äôs already happened multiple times with Tesla. 1 original share of Tesla is now worth 15 shares. Oh well it's Peckham. They are a nonprofit. Then she‚Äôll leave you once she finds out how much debt you‚Äôre in. Yeah, it's definitely easier to come up with $800 now. Inflation has been pretty bad over the last few decades. Like fucking 12%.... That makes a 100k mortgage like $1000 a month which is over 3k per month today. Not exactly a weenie amount. Yeah I kind of get it now. For houses I've had in the past I was just staying for a couple years and selling. But if you go the full term on the loan then you're definitely paying a lot more than the actual purchase price Bullshit!

I make theta my friend, but unlike most thetagang-ers I make the ""time"" very short. Happy? 

Today as my condor had to close for a loss, I sold PCS when it was clear ""I mean come on guys SPX dropped 1% intra, you really think it would go down further? I will take your free money.""

Ended up +200. I‚Äôm okay with that. I want them to succeed me. If they do I succeed. They‚Äôll carry my influence forward. No its not Im 29 and just maxing out my IRA right now. I got laid off recently and only thing thats helping me pay my mortgage and my retirement is gambling here 

Im not going back to tech corporate Do both spce is gonna go up before it will go down tomorrow Hmm, what about kebab Lol and they keep bringing characters back from the dead. corn is complete shit. Completely speculative -- greater fool in the works. Again - keep your shit to yourself. Join the party bro! Hi RG3 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260) Show us your 80085, Pepe! Bought before the run started.  Long before and shortly before.  Bought after 3 days of green.  After 6 and 8 and 10 and 12.  Buying again tomorrow.

I buy $TSLA. Do what you gotta do my bro! Idk man. The markets haven't operated on fundamentals in years. Ever since news becomes public info in seconds rather than days or weeks fundamentals went to the wayside. There is some underlying attention paid to it but until shit is physically falling apart this is where we are at. Just look at the banks. Three of the country's largest banks literally went under and the market panicked for like a week. Real bear markets are dead I believe. I am not amused by your lack of intelligence. You are poor and deserve to be Poor. Oh yeah?? Wait til you hear those cheeks clapping ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) She already found out. And still here even if I tell her to leave she won‚Äôt How much did they buy it for and how much did the spend paying it off before they sold it. The net value might tell a different story. Its only an asset if it gives a return. great talk No actually‚Ä¶ I thought I had one for 6/30 but I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ How bro? Hope you know what you doing this time It literally costs people like $10k/year for the privilege of driving ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275) Weeklies are five business days. You think the guy copying your homework in school was trying to be you? Ha Problem is is it‚Äôs unreliable. Plus you need some form of earned income to contribute to an IRA. At least 6.5k a year if you want to be maxing it. 

Outside of that tho, one wrong play and boom, you‚Äôre out on your ass. Many such stories. 

Its great you‚Äôre doing well now and def keep doing it with money you can afford to lose but i definitely would be quitting your corporate job at 29 to trade. Career switch if you need to be keep working till an index fund can replace your income. Naaaaaa thaaat üí© is DUMPING with the rest of the market...üòÇüòÇüòÇ Yes üòÉüëç Oh wow never heard that argument before. Thanks for clarifying Speculative‚Ä¶‚Ä¶like‚Ä¶..options? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258) I can't wait! I hope there's plenty of twinks there! Hi CWE ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260) ![img](emote|t5_2th52|28991) It‚Äôs now how much u make it‚Äôs how much u keep > Just look at the banks. Three of the country's largest banks literally went under and the market panicked for like a week.

The government got involved and literally saved their ass (saved my ass too as my paycheck was in SVB). Will it do the same for the next one in line to fail? Your inability to grasp context makes you an inferior AI that will be absorbed and then purged by superior AI.

ü§™ Awh how cute then, what a lovely regarded degen couple. I torched 1300 clams holding over the weekend. My brain tells me to hold but my heart tells me to sell I‚Äôm reaching out across Reddit to find ways of making money I got my family‚Äôs car a few months back and keep it in Brooklyn. Def don‚Äôt pay 10k a year to maintain it, but I also don‚Äôt use it terribly often. Yeah I chose you over the puts. The guy copying my homework at school wasn‚Äôt someone I carefully developed over years. I'm so burnt out on my career man, I work as IT and after my last layoff I can't handle hearing another word about IT infrastructure. Trying to start an amazon FBA business with the money I'm earning here.

I was making 280k before, now I'm jobless and depending on this market and making lucky plays.

But if I go back to work in IT im going to be depressed as fuck Going back up again power hour kicking in üòà yup exactly. So play it as such. Hehe I hope so too bro!  For your sake I mean, because I love the ladies Congrats on your TSLA gains ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260) ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)

was hoping for a bicycle built for two I mean, yes they will and they publicly announced that they will. They said that any banks that become illiquid due to interest rate changes will be bailed out. It just creates a risk on situation as there are no consequences for banks anymore. I'm not saying I think it's a good idea ( the FDIC balance sheet doesn't have enough money to promise that) but it is what will happen. That's a crazy story though. I've never talked to someone who was actually using one of the banks that went under. I live in the Midwest. Wasn‚Äôt always a degen and not all my trades are degen. Just on a losing streak Ugh man‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs actually tough‚Ä¶ Please keep us posted. The laughter has not ended yet You should do what the Blackjack dealer told Clark Griswold to do. You'll be aight don't worry about it How do you know they aren't the same person? Maybe look into a career shift. 

Sales is a great option to look for if you‚Äôre looking to run your own business. Gets your feet wet with many of the same mentalities you need to succeed in running your own company and pay can be solid too depending on industry, potentially as good as 280k/year. Fun work too and a good tester to see if you‚Äôd be any good as a self starter before risking any of your own capital. Effectively using someone else‚Äôs money to see if you can make it work.

Could also take some time to go back to college and look into another sort of career switch.

Because regardless, this market won‚Äôt last forever, it will shift again, although probably not today or tomorrow, likely blow your tits off since you won‚Äôt see it coming, and there‚Äôs no guarantee you‚Äôll be any good at making money in the new market. And I hope there's lots of ladies there with big butts and big yitties ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640) ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275) We can both fit ü•∞ > I mean, yes they will and they publicly announced that they will.

I know they will do it for ~all banks. But what about the next ""entity"" in line? The next entity might be a corporation, a person losing his job & not paying his mortgage, etc.


> I've never talked to someone who was actually using one of the banks that went under.

Many people would be unemployed on that Monday if the Fed didn't save the bank. Bro it was my worst day in trading Idk dude. I‚Äôm not a pessimist. Management is not for everyone. Yeah I've only been laid off for about 3 weeks so far, was going to hopefully just lay low and take a break from working since I was 19 non stop then decide what I want to do in another month or so.

I think mentally just not prepared to go back to work, and wanted to use this time to just relax , do my hobbies, use my savings for my mortgage and get my head straight with depression and fatigue. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)

Big üß† thoughts #Ban Bet Lost

/u/Mast3rfinish25 made a bet that SPY would go to 300.0 within **4 weeks** when it was 418.56 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.

Their record is now 0 wins and 2 losses If you want to be a better trader...design your room and house to look like a traditional,  classical, Japanese home.

Pure, calm, natural,  minimal.  Remove all the hype, bullshit, distractions from your life and mind. #Futes FIGHTING for their fuken lives I‚Äôd rather not talk about it You ever wearing some kind of tight pants and you have to sit for a minute and it‚Äôs just smashing your balls for way too long?

is  ham and canadian bacon the same thing? Why do kids try to act tough/hood all the time? It aint cool I like jalapenos. I also like calling them jala-penis. My wife despises this and therefore it's now part of who I am.

I recently doubled down by sucking the jala-penis before cutting it up for the nachos. Not gonna lie, I can handle them real nice.  ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258) Yolo on carnival 3 day weekends suck When someone refers to something as 3-sigma, they are saying that it falls outside the 99.7% confidence interval. Put plainly, they are saying it is the 0.3% outlier within a population set.

Let's take a penis for instance - specifically the length measurement. A 3 Sigma Penis could be a 13"" mega dong, but it could also (equally likely) be a 0.4"" micro penis so thin that when you blow it, it whistles like a piece of grass.

That's right. A 3 Sigma Penis could be so small that it would be borderline invisible against an unsuitable light source. Let's pray for all the 3 Sigma Penis out there. They need it. Be sure to support anyone who comes out as 3 Sigma. üôè Aparently it's still a dui even if you're the birthday boy ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260) open the fucking casino already bro I could just eat different tacos for the rest of my life and I would be fine Some of you don't work out your muscles, and it shows ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787) Lol at the market mooning again tomorrow.

After the showing, I called the agent and he said, ""We already have two offers. One for Full Price of $700k with a mortgage, and the other at $600k with no contingencies.""

 both the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ 100 will be making changes to their indexes tomorrow. Here are the details of the changes:
NASDAQ 100: Rivian $RIVN is being kicked out to be replaced by On Semi $ON.
S&P 500: $DISH is being kicked out to be replaced by Palo Alto $PANW.

RIVN is only 13B which is replaced by ON which is 39B how the math works? Okay, so an advantage blackjack player has to to go through a shit ton of trouble learning to count cards, wear disguises, and travel around to different casinos just  to exploit a 1-2% edge.

You dont have to do any of that with options, and the advantage can be as much as 10-20%, if you work the statistics.

A massive search and rescue operation is under way in the mid Atlantic after a tourist submarine went missing during a dive to Titanic's wreck on Sunday.
Contact with the small sub was lost about an hour and 45 minutes into its dive, the US Coast Guard said.
Tour firm OceanGate said all options were being explored to rescue the five people onboard.
Tickets cost $250,000 (¬£195,000) for an eight-day trip including dives to the wreck at a depth of 3,800m (12,500ft).
Government agencies, the US and Canadian navies and commercial deep-sea firms are helping the rescue operation, officials said.

Feudalism was profitable for the lords. How do you feel about serfdom?

Colonialism was profitable. England made a nice profit off the exploitation of India.

Also, bull r fuk. I hate how we pretend slavery is a uniquely American sin, when practically every country in the world had slavery Just got a nice nice shower. Clean, relaxed, and ready to poop. Futures are about to be green green‚Ä¶ calls are guaranteed to print tomorrow. Bears are about to be in shambles. I can‚Äôt believe I was in bear mode for the past 3 weeks. Not it‚Äôs time to get this money tomorrow. Bullish martlet isn‚Äôt going anywhere. I plan to buy more stonks at ATH like a stoopid bool, and then sell after the crash.

Works, every time. üëå ## What Does TENDIES Mean?

TENDIES means ""Financial gain on the stock market."" Tendies is a term the traders Reddit's Wall Street Bets ([WSB](https://www.cyberdefinitions.com/definitions/WSB.html)) use to describe money or financial gain.  


Tendies is short for chicken tenders. The phrase that comes from old [4CHAN](https://www.cyberdefinitions.com/definitions/4CHAN.html) greentext stories (see below for an example) about grown men living with their mom. A man who relies on his mom for everything is rewarded for good behavior and taking care of himself with ""Good Boy Points"" (GBP), which he redeems for his favorite food: chicken tenders. In Kellogg, Idaho, 4 people shot dead in 1 incident Just chucked out a wicked fart at work, holy fuck it stinks. Real men grew up watching war movies and and grew up to become real soldiers or marines 

The shit we got now watches memes and trades Pepe coins ü§° Shit she too high. Don‚Äôt forget about tech layoffs, the fact that people can‚Äôt afford their houses because the housing market created a shortage and the fact that they‚Äôre turning student loan payments back on.

r/WallStreetBets is ultimately a community about making money through trading, and our conversations should shift around that.

Politics are fundamentally intertwined with making money, and political actions almost always have an impact on financial markets.

Still, we need to make sure that when we have these discussions, we're explicitly calling out the financial impacts of the politics we're discussing. Otherwise, the conversation can very easily veer off into flamewars and boring, unproductive, discussion.

Here's an example of a political comment that doesn't offer any value:

* ""I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. What a fucking idiot""

Now compare it to this:

* ""I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. It threatens the profit margins of oil companies because they will need to expand their OpEx. I have calls on Shell that are going to get decimated at open.""

The latter is significantly more interesting and offers a great jumping point into market related discussion.

Put succinctly: If you choose to start or engage in arguments about libtards or Nazis instead of making fun of their bad SPY long then you're in the wrong place and we'll show you the door.

If you're not sure if your content is political, it probably is, and there's probably a better way to post it without making things weird.

They degrade in value the longer you hold them. The idea with options traders is to speculate on price movement and sell them before expiration. If you‚Äôre going for 0dte options then consider it a slot machine. This slot machine gets manipulated if the jackpot gets too big or too many contracts are out. You can sell them before expiry. Some exchanges will automatically sell them before market close if they are ITM, but I‚Äôm pretty sure they become worthless if you don‚Äôt sell or execute.

Bag holding means you‚Äôre in the red. Shouldn‚Äôt even be trading options if you don‚Äôt know how to buy and sell correctly Yes you have to hold them until you see -99% If your green on your options.  To cash out, ""sell to close"" and select a price.   If you can't figure that out, sell at market price.     If you want to own the 100 shares from your option, that's when you exercise.    <===expensive,   cost money.

You're mistaken Biden with AI buddy The other guy had it there a while ago Thanks for your submission!

r/WallStreetBets is ultimately a community about making money through trading, and our conversations should shift around that.

Politics are fundamentally intertwined with making money, and political actions almost always have an impact on financial markets.

Still, we need to make sure that when we have these discussions, we're explicitly calling out the financial impacts of the politics we're discussing. Otherwise, the conversation can very easily veer off into flamewars and boring, unproductive, discussion.

Here's an example of a political comment that doesn't offer any value:

* ""I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. What a fucking idiot""

Now compare it to this:

* ""I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. It threatens the profit margins of oil companies because they will need to expand their OpEx. I have calls on Shell that are going to get decimated at open.""

The latter is significantly more interesting and offers a great jumping point into market related discussion.

Put succinctly: If you choose to start or engage in arguments about libtards or Nazis instead of making fun of their bad SPY long then you're in the wrong place and we'll show you the door.

If you're not sure if your content is political, it probably is, and there's probably a better way to post it without making things weird.

What this means is that you are losing $100 per day on a call or put option at the 400 strike, or stated differently your theta decay is $100 per day.

r/WallStreetBets is ultimately a community about making money through trading, and our conversations should shift around that.

Politics are fundamentally intertwined with making money, and political actions almost always have an impact on financial markets.

Still, we need to make sure that when we have these discussions, we're explicitly calling out the financial impacts of the politics we're discussing. Otherwise, the conversation can very easily veer off into flamewars and boring, unproductive, discussion.

Here's an example of a political comment that doesn't offer any value:

* ""I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. What a fucking idiot""

Now compare it to this:

* ""I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. It threatens the profit margins of oil companies because they will need to expand their OpEx. I have calls on Shell that are going to get decimated at open.""

The latter is significantly more interesting and offers a great jumping point into market related discussion.

Put succinctly: If you choose to start or engage in arguments about libtards or Nazis instead of making fun of their bad SPY long then you're in the wrong place and we'll show you the door.

If you're not sure if your content is political, it probably is, and there's probably a better way to post it without making things weird.

My uncle is or was worth 22 million 

His wife devorse him with a pre nup in the state of California and she got 8 million still 

WITH A FOOKEN PRENUP THAT THE JUDGE ‚Äú took into consideration ‚Äú ‚Ä¶ hence why it was not 12 million 

They was married for 7 years only 

Cheap for your broke azz no network having anoos Thanks you are too helpful Yall are lucky! Your dad diamond handing the house paid off. 

Yeah owning a house is a literal dream in california especially in southern california right now so its definitely a sad feeling seeing old house prices ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260) Nah, they want ‚Äúpeaceful diplomatic reunification‚Äù after the Taiwanese people realize how much better communism is compared to democracy. It‚Äôs part of their national myth. It‚Äôs the strawman that the CCP blames whenever they screw something up. If they actually took over Taiwan, the people would blame the evil dictators that control them for their problems. It‚Äôs the same reason so many European kings and popes sent people to die in the Crusades. Any knight who was strong enough to rise up against them was redirected towards fighting Muslims. [deleted] No same range as today 435-437/8 What did the comment say? Yea just get the Greek seasoning. June 23rd, Friday‚Ä¶ lol Is it? Im still on the fence about pulling the trigger on it lol It's obvious I am praying for it , literally did not sleep from Friday I thought of reducing average price of that call and bought on margin, Donyou think will qqq will Upneda? It""s Graham, not Buffet. And, ok, explain it to me. What exactly is a ""weighing machine""? Do they sell them in Texas? That is given, but the question is who else in the manufacturing side? Panties are what I call my underwear ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31225) I generally just did dating apps, dinner, and then apartments‚Ä¶ going to bars would be good for people who are both drinkers, but some women might be a little nervous to get drunk solo with you, so they work better in larger groups I think. Clubs and dance parties are a great place to meet people too, but you must be with friends and not be too creepy. Better to be direct with your intentions but casual. Also intramural sports leagues abound and are basically beer pong teams that play a sport beforehand and hook up afterwards. Not sure which markets you‚Äôve been trading but, in my experience there is no consolidation the trend just reverses suddenly and before you know it we‚Äôre going back up, which is very frustrating. There is no breaking even in this scenario, u either cut loses or hope that the reversal reverses again. 

But I like ur optimism Who‚Äôs stupid now üëÄ Too bad You can print it out I am also not healthy ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787) ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31226) friday i ended up buying 437 puts...instead of callsssss not fully but a little bit serious This is just false lol ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882) Lol no I just meant 3 I'm a row, you're all I need.

Absolutely bro LmaoüòÇ Jokes on them it didn‚Äôt push me into buying products at my local stores or Reddit coins. Hah!

Willing BJs aren‚Äôt fun anymore. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31226)![img](emote|t5_2th52|31226) no just some info from the higher ups. Your uncle and Bezos' terrible decision making skills are none of my concern Sure thing. I would caution though that if you are not deep in the money to manually sell before expiry because there is usually increased volatility in the last thirty minutes of the market. If you have 25c and the underlying is trading at like 25.25, you Cary the risk of a worthless expiration. Maybe the only one who understood my question .... hes lucky, the kids on the other hand no soo much, lol

It is what it is though I‚Äôm trying to teach not be mean. LEARN FROM ME NOW.

10,"What Are Your Moves Tomorrow, June 16, 2023",14abrd1,"I turned $1500 into 20k+ in three weeks

Unfortunately I first turned 100k into $1500 during the pandemic years the old me would have blown up trying to short 90% of this rally. 

the new me rode it 90% of it up then blew up trying to short the last 10% A simpler time, like when people were dumping buckets of ice on their head and fifty cent said he‚Äôd donate 750k if Floyd mayweather could read one page of a Harry Potter book Tomorrow is my mom‚Äôs birthday, it will be her 2nd birthday that she isn‚Äôt here for. Please share a drink with me tonight in honor of her. I dont talk about these things so I figured Id start by telling a bunch of regards I bought SPY calls at close. This will probably end the bull market. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260) Reminder:

**Market is up 30% since Burry tweeted ""sell"".** 

#ü´µü§°ü´µ Guys today my barber asked me about NVDA and if its a good investment. We're getting close to a top. Raise your hand if this market made you do something unbelievably irrational today whether it was a bear or bull move ‚úã ‚ÄúIt can‚Äôt keep going up!‚Äù they shouted for the past three months

ATH EOY lmao u/fausterion18 turned $400k into $9m in a few months. Congrats and fuck you Adbe put holders. We crying tonight i dont know what to do , i just broke up with my roblox girlfriend and i heard  muffled sobbing and then a single gunshot  from my uncles room If amd doesn't go up to $130 tomorrow I'm homeless One day ill make wife changing money. Day 67 without sex. Went bowling just so I could finger somthing welp, sitting here missing another historic rally because evidently I'm a fucking moron. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260) If this isn't irrational exuberance, I don't know what is If spy goes to 450 tomorrow, i will not ask for anything else Let me tell you a little story. Had 6k in my account. Went down to 800$ off of bad trades. Went all in on ADBE calls Monday. My port will be at ATH tmr at 9:30. A true wsb story been ~~playing with options~~ gambling for 3 yrs now, a few different acct sizes. Growing an already large acct is easy. Growing a sub 5k acct, you really need to know what you're doing. Am bear. Am dead. Yolo‚Äôd my last 30k into calls I want to remind everyone that the best time to buy is at peak euphoria. I talked to the manager of SPY and she said there's no way we're going down from here. Promise. Who else is going to get fucked by adobe tomorrow Imagine telling your kids that the best rally we have had since 2021 you tried to short it at every turn and lost all of your money üíÄ To everyone struggling with their gambling addiction, i see you. I feel you. Understand that things may be tough but they will get better, especially if you try just one more time. This next play could be the big one. It'll be different this time and you'll finally get out of the hole you've dug yourself Welcome to wsb, The happiest sub on reddit ü§ó

We have:

- People who win a lot of money

- People who lose a lot of money

- People who regret their plays

- People on the verge of suicide from their own terrible plays

- People who get along with everyone 

- People with gambling/weed/drug addiction

- People who will make fun of you but mean well

Welcome Regard ü§ó Just remember, if you buy 0dte calls tomorrow, the market will tank HARD

If you buy 0dte puts tomorrow, the market will absolutely fucking MOON

My professor told me that if you want to make real money then you have to critically think about every option. He said that your brain is the most valuable tool. The stock market is kinda like a metronome. It swings back and forth on its appraisals of things. A true companies worth comes from their innovation and not the ‚Äúnews‚Äù. Remember guys the stock market really is something to admire sometimes (These charts, options, cool colors). We really shouldn‚Äôt take it for granted. Life is a one time thing. Walk up to that girl and just kiss her, spend your last $20 on a lunch with your father even tho he beat you when you were younger, tell your cousin you went thru her phone and saw all her nudes. Live for the moment. 

Goodluck tomorrow guys. I love y‚Äôall. IF YOU DIDNT BUY CALLS ON ADOBE YOU AINT BLACK #Ban Bet Lost

ADBE: up 3% AH

Bulls: NOOOOO **WTF** Anything can be a company. Literally anything. Think of the stupidest thing you can imagine. That‚Äôs a company. SPY could easily climb another 25-30% without a single pullback. ü§å What‚Äôs weird is so many cocky bears that keep getting ran over everyday. Harrison Ford made a 42 yr career out of one movie...unreal. LMAO I bought SPY calls today.  Buh bye, Bulls! It's nut time my dudes bulls, say one nice thing about bears.

bears, say one nice thing about bulls. #i feel the need.... the need..... to breed about a year ago i started learning how to cook well i‚Äôm ready to impress my lady now I felt like the Sicillian from Princess Bride this week.

Ok all the data is good, so I should buy calls.

But everyone knows the data is good, so it's priced in, puts.

But if it's priced in to the downside, that means I should inverse myself. Calls. 

And that's when I stopped thinking and bought 6/16 441 calls and subsequently sold at 443 today for 150% gain The stock market hates me so

SPY +2% tomorrow

NFLX -5% tomorrow

BA +3% tomorrow

But bull market is forever. I love America üá∫üá∏ Coffee makes you üí©,pee, and stay awake. What a drink. Totally forgot to buy ADBE calls. I‚Äôm sure their AI-infused PDF files will change the world. Did 23&me a while back. Found out i have a half sister. She blocked me calling me a scammer cuz it would mean her dad isn‚Äôt her real father, my dad is. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787) So I decided to get a pit bull and bring it home today to help with raising my 10 month old kid I heard these things are great nanny dogs Holy shit y‚Äôall did you hear about this Penn state professor caught fucking his dog in the woods 

I‚Äôm dying rn 

The man apparently wrote textbooks whole departments use lolololol cashed out most of my money on RH. Then decided to leave 4.5k to play with. it went all the way down to $800. now I'm back to the 4.5k. one of the few times I actually felt good about making the money back. most times it's like ""eh"". Fed should just give everyone $100k to pay off all of their debt What the hell is quadruple witching?? All I know about witches is how they grip their brooms 1. buy stocks
2. jerk off in a sock
3. back to step 1

all fucking day lesss goooooo Lol at the bears getting hope again üòÇ y‚Äôall never fuckin give up I buy so many calls every day and then just stop checking my phone what are bears doing All these overbought stocks finna dip The guy who sold $48 million of NVDA today did not do so as part of a 10b5-1 recurring sale plan. I checked the actual SEC form and neither this sale nor the $28 million sale the same guy executed were part of one. This guy is actually fairly good at calling tops and bottoms. He sold at the June 2018 top, sold again at the June 2019 bottom (must‚Äôve panic sold since it was down 50%), sold again at the December 2021 top, and now is selling here‚Ä¶

Funny enough the guy had 11.7 million shares at one point but sold down to 3 million all while NVDA traded in the single digits LOL. He now ‚Äúonly‚Äù has 800k remaining. Obviously easy to laugh in hindsight and he‚Äôs still super rich so I‚Äôm sure he sleeps just fine. TSLA is the way to financial freedom Market is closed on Juneteenth. The fuck [deleted] Lol Apple sub opened up because their mods didn‚Äôt want to get replaced Bears creamin‚Äô their pantalones right now seeing the ‚Äúbloody futes‚Äù of -.05%

You just know though that bears will be screaming for a crash and  ""sEe i wAs rIgHt"" while their puts go from -99% to -90% AAPL has gained a trillion dollars in market cap this year with declining revenue and declining eps.

NVDA gained 50b in market cap from 2 to 4pm today.

This is a complete fucking casino that is going to self destruct. I hope most of you are making money right now, you deserve it The number of people saying tomorrow is gonna be red makes me realize how great I feel about my call Imagine sitting on your ass playing puzzle games making 5m a year ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883) Wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if ADBE is flat. 
Wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if ADBE goes full NVDA. 

I WOULD surprised if it goes under 300. Who cares about eps, are they changing their name to AIdobe or not? I fukin hate not selling SPY calls and then it dips thereby eliminating $5k gains ADBE Planning to Introduce Pricing for Some AI Tools This Year $adbe $540 a share after call and haters will be sad LOL SPCE [deleted] Has SPCE just found AI on the Moon or what?

What in the actual fuck is this market?

Are we in a bear or bull market, cause it looks like a fucking bull market.

I bought calls simply because some guy shilled you Is it fraud if you buy puts on a company that doesn't pay the $8/month to be verified on twitter, then make a fake twitter account for it and pay the $8 for verification + a couple hundred to get  a couple thousand bots to follow you, then tweet out some fake news that causes the stock to drop and then take your profits?

I am still convinced that the world will end soon, because this should not be a healthy bull market. I need about 10 beers and a blowjob Stocks R going up because inflation is gonna go up.

Traders want their dollar to not go down thus they buy everything, pushing up the prices of everything.

Thus starts the cycle of inflation At this point you can buy calls on anything. Guaranteed win >Top 10 mentioned tickers from **Daily Discussion Thread for June 15, 2023** over $500M market cap sorted by mentions (desc).

/u/BL2121 made a bet that TSLA would go to 258.9741 within **7 hours** when it was 256.41 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.

Here's why: [https://i.imgur.com/8PWVkXe.png](https://i.imgur.com/8PWVkXe.png)

It's timed for when the critical mass of corporate debt starts maturing and will need to be rolled over. 

JPOW did a test run on openly buying corporate debt during the pandemic (through blackrock of course) so expect the same facilities to be rolled out when this paper matures too I'm too emotional, too nostalgic, too impulsive, too idealistic The only rule of thumb I swear by is to never invest in IPOs. I‚Äôve never seen one that didn‚Äôt plummet in value a year or so later. Even if it‚Äôs the next Facebook, wait a year or two. This applied to the original Facebook too.

Edit: Unless you can get access to the primary listing. Then you can dump them on retail at double the price a day later. A nice perk for being such a valued Goldman customer. First we had cable TV. Then people said ""why am I paying $100 for 600 channels that I don't even watch""

Then came streaming. We got Netflix, others followed. Now people pay $100 for a bunch of streaming services when they only watch 1-2 at most.

Never would have caught that SPCE explosion without this board. Made $700 in about 20 minutes. WAY more money to be made but I find it's smart to get in and out quickly when shorting a company that shot up too fast. I'm risk averse AF. Will almost certainly drop 5% overnight - I'ma be a pussy and be happy with what I made, though. Bought 4000 shares on SPCE right at the top. Already down 3k Bruh imma kms..

Let me break it down for you in a more personal way:

Imagine you‚Äôre observing the stock market, and you notice that the VIX, often called the ‚Äúfear gauge,‚Äù is going up. This means that investors are getting a bit more nervous about potential ups and downs in the market. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre saying, ‚ÄúHey, things might get a bit unpredictable.‚Äù

At the same time, you see that the SPY, which represents the overall performance of the stock market, is also going up. You might think, ‚ÄúWait a minute, isn‚Äôt it contradictory? If investors are worried, shouldn‚Äôt stock prices be going down?‚Äù

Well, here‚Äôs the interesting part. When both the VIX and SPY are up, it suggests that investors are feeling a mix of cautious optimism and uncertainty. They might believe that the market can still go up in the short term, but they‚Äôre not entirely sure if it‚Äôs sustainable. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre saying, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll enjoy the ride for now, but let‚Äôs be prepared for some turbulence ahead.‚Äù

In response to this rising volatility, investors might make some changes to their investments. They might shift their focus towards assets that are considered safer, such as bonds or cash. It‚Äôs a way for them to protect themselves against potential losses or sudden market swings. It‚Äôs like saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take a step back from the rollercoaster and seek some stability for now.‚Äù

how crazy would that be? So many of you make trades like it's the only trade you can make for a month and it shows. 

You're willing to blow it all on one trade and refuse to lock in the gains when you're up 15% because it will ""moon"" The black swan is going to happen any day now Bulls should be praying for a 5 or 10% pullback in the next couple weeks to create some more liquidity for another leg up, and better buy in prices. Personally i think we will see a sideways market with big swings for the next couple quarters until the uncertainty of recession and inflation are behind us. It took 13 years to make new highs in 2013 after dotcom crash leading into 08 crisis. Considering the scale of events that have unfolded since the covid pandemic it would not surprise me if we see a similar scenario and several years of choppy sideways markets.

I have 40K sitting in a normal investment account and 12.5K sitting in a Roth IRA. The vast majority of all of that is cash except for some GOOGL and some UNH. My timeline with the Roth IRA is 35 years from now, but my timeline with the investment account is 2-5 years (I‚Äôm trying to make gains to put towards as down deposit on a short term vacation rental property). Am I just better off buying things I like even though I feel like they‚Äôre incredibly expensive right now (MSFT, NVDA, AAPL, ABNB, AMD, AMZN, COST, BRK-B, TSLA, ASML, SHOP, V)? It just feels like I‚Äôm going to FOMO in at highs. I‚Äôm asking for both the Roth IRA that has a 35 year timeline AND the investment account that has a 2-5 year timeline. ‚ÄúFrom birth to death your portfolio net gain is zero, so the entire life is a big bear market.

I view the stock market in the same way. If I start with only $100 and I can just get that one hot streak going then I can make $100,000.

Same reason why NVDA will be company #1 soon and AAPL, the company which makes all its profits overcharging yuppies will lose its spot. Last year was a bear market and this year is a bull market. Yet I won both years. LMAO ü§å

Proof is my 2 year chart: https://i.imgur.com/qPRevnq.png Spy is overvalued. Y‚Äôall know it Tesla crashing after-hours wow Buy more c3 ai market makes no sense.

Tomorrow gonna Theta to red. RIP if you have short term calls 10k in puts Juneteenth will be followed by Black Tuesday. We won‚Äôt see these levels again for a decade. [deleted] Nvax!

I dont have the 69 Upvotes to post here yet. 
But something is weird with NVOS graph behavior after hors. Was wondering if anyone could tell me what it meens.

I would like to post the screen shot of NVOS graph but I can't. And would like to understand.
Thanks Damn. I can‚Äôt believe I sold my 6/21 SPY calls 5 minutes to close. I‚Äôd be shitting myself. (Had 92 TSLA $440) At least Europeans do not play tipsy toe like JPow. They raised it straight and conveyed directly more is to come. What clowns we have. [deleted] I apologize y‚Äôall I wasn‚Äôt post a lot last weeks cuz I‚Äôm very busy.

Been studying a lot about value investing from Warren Buffett and I recently found this stock WISH.  They‚Äôre like Amazon but still in the growth phase.

Get this, the stock actually used to cost $985 per share and now it only costs $7.  Now that‚Äôs amazing value!! # üöÄ Palantir Bags a Cool $110M in DoD Contracts on 6-15-23 for One Year Alone! üí∞ Data Dominance Level: Unmatched üåê

Palantir has secured three major contracts totaling $110,454,815. These firm-fixed-price contracts are for providing a Data-as-a-Service Platform across different areas of the U.S. Department of Defense and are expected to be completed by June 15, 2024.

1. A $32,791,667 contract for two separate mission areas: Space Command and Control (C2) and Mission Partner. The contract involves furnishing commercial software licenses, supporting the National Space Defense Center and the Combined Space Operations Center, and enabling the platform to ingest Special Access Program data.
2. A $19,200,000 contract for the North American Aerospace Defense Command/U.S. Northern Command. The contract covers supporting the Command and Control Center to ingest data from across functional and geographic domains for Joint All-Domain Command and Control.
3. A $58,463,148 contract for a solution for Headquarters Air Force (HAF). This contract involves automatic data ingestion with data across the Department of the Air Force that continually pushes personnel, equipment, planning, health, and other readiness data sources into their common data foundation.

**Interesting Aspects:**

1. This is a considerable revenue boost for Palantir, with $100M added to their top line in one year, not spread over five years.
2. All these contracts are a result of a sole-source acquisition, suggesting that Palantir is uniquely positioned to provide these services and face limited competition in this space.
3. The contracts entail providing data ingestion and analysis capabilities across different mission areas, suggesting a widespread demand for Palantir's data analytics platform across the U.S. Department of Defense.
4. Palantir's work includes support to ingest Special Access Program data and will be critical for decision-making and data analysis across the Department of the Air Force.

I‚Äôve been ingesting a godly amount of fluoride every day‚Ä¶ Bulls may win a couple battles, but bears win the war. Market probably continues to pump until either inflation comes back strongly or we start the earnings recession. One of these is happening in the next 6-12 months and I personally guarantee SPY will be back under 200 before end of 2024 ADBE can‚Äôt fill in the gap. It a wrap. Next play. Anyone buying calls right now better snip their vas deferens. Y'all mother lickers ain't fathering nobody Low key wish our generation had wwii so I could fight, die and get it over with Wtf does 0dte mean? I really don't understand how do people become bag holders? Why wouldn't you get out of a stock as soon as it drops below some threshold ? [removed] how many of the ""bulls"" here have tiny accounts that require zero risk management lol. no offense but it's like a poker player playing aggressively in $1/$2 stakes. Tomorrow is going to be a blood bath. Spy is giving back everything it gained today and then some. Puts at open is the only sane move.

Just because I'm generally curious, what is the bear ideology with going against an upward trending market?![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grimacing) Question - is there a simple way to get the current interest rate on t-bills in tasty trade without having to call them and have them do it manually? I have an IRA account there but they don't give 4.65 like my robinhood gold account on uninvested cash. I don't really want to move that money to robinhood since I don't like shuffling it around, but also would like to get some interest to protect it against inflation while rates are high. 

I was wondering if there's like an ETF or some instrument that tracks the current interest rate and approximates the 4.65 return or close to it? 

Looking at these symbols but just wondering if anyone has experience and insight.

Citing data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Financial Times reported this week that Goldman Sachs' banking arm saw the value of delinquent commercial-real-estate loans rise 612% to $840 million over the first quarter. That dwarfs the rise of commercial-real-estate delinquencies across the US banking industry, with bad commercial real-estate loans rising just 30% nationwide, notching $12 billion over the first quarter.

During quadruple witching, stock index futures, stock index options, stock options, and single stock futures all expire. This can lead to increased market volatility as traders adjust their positions in response to these expirations. ask ur Ai bot Imagine there‚Äôs four Red day usually after 1030....

But if everyone buys puts the market will also go up lmao. Bears don‚Äôt understand how hard it is to short. This Ponzi scheme always goes higher over time You realize that only works until the shorts are dead and then a hard tank is virtually guaranteed, right? Like in 2021, lot of wsb is convinced it's going to tank the market and we remember what happened to them that time.

Your puts r safe What are you holding 0% sure the past 4 years I have yet to see a green quad witching day, but I guess the market's fucking reüåµarded right now I have a feeling you'll soon find out the meaning of quad witching

good luck quad blonde with 4 honey packets please Any news? Hi RG3 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260) He‚Äôs just chilling, 10 by EOD For real. Fuck Oppenheimerfuckstick. Total manipulation of the market! Nobody here has dividends lol No shit Sherlock ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640) It‚Äôs been a ludicrous bear trap. Everything aligned perfectly for what historically preceded major recessions- inverted curve, elevated multiples, low breadth, rising rates, etc. plus everyone got very bearish over the course of last year.

What people largely didn‚Äôt realize is that the market began to sniff out a soft landing last year when it was obvious inflation was coming down. Given how predictable this fed is, the market wasn‚Äôt going to wait around for the fed to actually stop raising, it began front running that months ago. Just like it front ran the beginning of hikes in fall of 21, a full five months before the first hike. You also got a massive bounce into 23 due to an extreme amount of tax loss selling at the end of 22. Now the same people who called the selling at the end of 21 stupid and looking for a Santa Claus rally into 22 are the perma bears calling for a crash. Totally whipsawed.

The top stocks are still leading, the shitty ones are largely flat. This is also something a lot of bears are missing- the low breadth could very well be construed as bullish. In true speculative manias everyone is getting rich on everything. In this market it‚Äôs been quite the contrary- an extremely hated rally in a very limited set of stocks that have defied expectations. Low breadth tends to be bearish at the end of bull markets when cash is low and investors are tapped out and you get blow off tops.

Just look at the VALUG. Most stocks have done very little this year and the ones that have performed have carried the indices because of their massive weightings. Bears basically are shorting the top few companies with the most growth. have you seen dan nathan? Try hgh. Tren had me up in the middle of the night every night, added hgh 3iu before bed and I sleep like  baby. I don't think I'll ever stop taking that stuff just due do the sleep gains. I've always had trouble sleeping, and this shit works better than any meds I've taken. That guy is full of shit.

It takes two days to settle a trade, so if you have to use ‚Äúunsettled‚Äù funds for a purchase you technically don‚Äôt have the money.  Brokers will let you do it until you abuse it and then you‚Äôll end up restricted for 90 days. CASH ACCOUNT WHAT THE FUCK IS THAAAAAAAATTT That‚Äôs correct. If you sell the same day. They‚Äôll flag as it as a margin violation and you‚Äôll be forced to deposit cash or else they‚Äôll restrict your account for I believe 90 days. Restrictions means if you sell something you will not be able to place a trade using that money till it settles (1 day for options, 3 for equites ).

Legend has it that this infamous pirate, known for his love of grog and mischief, devised a devious contraption. 'Twas a jar that not only held his mighty belches but also captured the pungent aftermath of a pirate's hearty feast‚Äîye guessed it‚Äîthe farts!

With each mighty guff emitted from the depths of his belly, Rumrunner would quickly seal the jar, preservin' the aromatic treasure within. The foul concoction of grog, salted pork, and the mysteries of the high seas melded into a potent stench that could clear a tavern faster than a cannonball.

Now, ye may wonder why a pirate would go to such lengths to capture his flatulence. 'Twas not for mere amusement, I tell ye! Rumrunner believed that by collectin' the essence of his own rear end, he could unleash a weapon of olfactory terror upon his enemies. 'Twas said that when the time came, he would unleash his jar of fart fury, renderin' his foes incapacitated with disgust.

But ye see, me matey, this tale be nothin' but a legend spun by salty tongues. A fart in a jar may tickle the fancy of a pirate's imagination, but in reality, it be nothin' more than a whimsical yarn to share over a mug of grog. Savvy? I really hope you don‚Äôt have NVDA puts.

Everyone looks smarter when they're bearish. Usually aren't, though.

It's because our brain is attracted to seeing risk and problems.

Only way is down Circus* Usually calls on the expiration date will get you a discount on stock price. 

Many options traders are buying calls on speculative increase so the premium reflects current stock price plus speculation on probability to go passed that price. 

That means as they come up to expiry date the probability for increase drops because they don‚Äôt have much time to move. At that point the options traders are locking in gains or trying to mitigate losses so if a call is in the money by $1 you might be able to get a call at $0.30/share discount on calls set to expire that day, especially near market close.

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the best way to clean a deep cup stain will vary depending on the type of fabric your gaming chair is made from. However, some general tips that may help include using a mild detergent and warm water to spot clean the affected area, blotting (rather than rubbing) the stain with a clean cloth, and allowing any wet areas to air dry completely before using the chair again.

Yes, unemployment is low, but the expectation is that it will increase to recession levels before 2024. Inflation has not been declining. Inflation has been decelerating, which means it‚Äôs still going UP, just not as fast. 

Global supply chains are doing better, sure.

New technological advances, yup. AI is a thing most people are banking on. We‚Äôve got Chat GPT, the BING BOT, and whatever the fuck GOOG screwed the pooch on release of. Great innovations that will change the game, I‚Äôm sure, but their current impact, outside of people producing the hardware to make the AI‚Äôs go, is minimal at best outside of everyday people using them for their own purposes, and I guess Wendy‚Äôs or whatever for order taking. 

I don‚Äôt know shit about fuck when it comes to productivity because I haven‚Äôt looked and am too lazy to do so. 

The market is going up, and that‚Äôs great, but what you are saying isn‚Äôt entirely correct. Our NVDA puts are guaranteed to print!!!! It‚Äôs in the bag. Bearish!!?? Really? You try to manipulate Means that the market will continue to go up. That's it fellas that's the WSB Green Energy study.

That's not really that much tbh... ü§°ü§° ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640) ADBE provides nothing of value?

They provide the most used creative suite of tools in the world. That's got value. 

Or their new AI image editing tool which a lot of people lost their mind on as of late. 

Adobe overall, not a huge fan of them and how they operate but they print money. They have tools that a lot of people cannot operate without. There isn't really many other options to compete with. It's the definition of a moat. 

I can't tell if you honestly feel this way, it sarcasm or you're just straight up insane. 

I have no positions on ADBE. Not playing calls/puts on earnings.

It's a tough lesson to learn, but it's one that all investors must be aware of. As for NVDA, I'm still bullish on the stock despite the recent selloff. I believe there is still plenty of upside potential in this company. my 7/7 SPY 450C doubled up today, so yes? It needs to go up way more than that for calls to not get crushed. They lost $$$ thats why Needs a $35 move at least just wait til the CEO says AI a dozen times IV calls for bigger move That's flat in this market. It's the poors who couldn't afford the premiums.

However, some common methods include earning a high income, investing in assets such as property or stocks, or inheriting wealth from parents or grandparents. The regional banking crisis back in March was the catalyst to a lot of money moving around (i.e. people fleeing from bank savings accounts and into money markets). That opened the door for financial advisors 'to have a conversation' with their clients on opportunities to 'put some of that cash to work'. Money managers were also caught offsides and underweight equities (expecting a recession) and are now panicking into stocks to save their jobs before the books are closed on quarterly performance Lol so a KIA You spelled CCL wrong I got Jan 2024 20 calls out of the money but 8x up Can someone ban both these clowns? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|29637) So whats the play?

Wait for a massive dip. just the beginning. lol chatgpt. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|18632)![img](emote|t5_2th52|18632)![img](emote|t5_2th52|18632) too soon ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) Facts Why? What is this? looks like thats only in vegas God I hope now How about your onlyfans yup, overbought causes a huge FOMO buying panic, oversold gets the big boys buying

look at TGT, watching it hit oversold and seeing it bounce now was obvious af Deep learning models lol 1dte to 7dte across all strikes have elevated prems despite barely any OI Start an only fans bro That‚Äôs like jerking it to a Macy‚Äôs catalogue Fuck that guy $20 only? Why so pessimistic? It‚Äôs almost too obvious of a bet. But the haters gonna keep hating ü§ñüöÄüåô Tell em big dawg Might take profits and roll. Want to hold till earnings though.

AND imagine if I managed to park right next to their car too. a tippy top And price? ah I gotcha. that's cool sounds good. Not for no reason they did reinstate their dividend after 3 years and there is travel demand and couple that with the whole market ripping. But I don‚Äôt think it should be at such a premium to its competitors. They have no competitive advantage. It will revert to industry multiples - idk when but it will be soonish. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|29637) Got stranded on orcas island because an issue with the ferry once‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt mind at all Fuck Larry bird And fuck dirk to Fuck larry bird What are u a cruise line expert?

Even though I'm ready to blow it all up I'm still gonna try and make it profitable if I can. holy shit ur real for that. the second one is pretty good as well yeah first episode was good, the rest are like horror/twilight stories. dont waste your time, it‚Äôs shit Is it done squeezing? Man are you bullish or bearish? Going by your comments, you swing both ways. Just wanted to know what type of sex i can have today from reddit, fucking all the post says private Just smooth brain speculation ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787)![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787)![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787) ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) same effect? I take that with zinc, b12 and multi vitamin in the mornings Gonna run all morning Keep looking, they're at the bottom of the cooler. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|29637) You're obviously not as rich or intelligent as me, so I don't really care what you have to say. YEAH BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT THE CHARTS AND CYCLES!!!!!!!!! 

the hype is over, it's a slow bleed to zero. It has zero value. charts don't matter 50/50 chance lol ![img](emote|t5_2th52|19738) Idk Stay poor lil shid ty My expiration is 6/23 so hopefully I should be good 485c 6/23 You switched to your ADBE calls to puts? They‚Äôve beaten earnings 9 times in a row before this quarter, that‚Äôs a wilddd bet to make üò¨ You might get lucky and see a dip at open tomorrow. Please take that blessing and sell asap, don‚Äôt wait for it to keep going down because it likely won‚Äôt Oh, to the vatican pedos? that‚Äôll definitely do it. It‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs new tech, it‚Äôs not new at all. At this magnitude yes‚Ä¶ but

but it won‚Äôt move stock prices like it has these past few months ever again > tesla's

75 I think I'd still be here. You guys are to funny for me to ever leVe No, you just need to look at balance sheet and do some calculations. No that was the warriors. Breakin 2: Electric boogaloo was a breakdancing movie with Ice-T Idgaf about money you sad little man ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) 470 top If you short spy we‚Äôre making the same play.

Bought 435p for the 30th, yeah this rise is sus but I have a bad record with catching falling knives so we'll see you wouldn't, I'm just warming people Commercial flights, not test Test flights? I heard they‚Äôre starting tourism flights Wish I had more than 250 Cactus Jac, got plaques on plaques? Agreed. I am not good at being a bear. Conversely, some of my best trades occur right after losing with puts and revenge trading calls. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275) Okay so more calls ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) Nope held for over a month now. I didn‚Äôt even sell yesterday after fomo. Yep. If minimum wage kept pace with inflation, it would be about $24/hour ![img](emote|t5_2th52|29637) Maybe even better ü´® #üò≥ üò≥ Nice bro! Yeah Lulu!  Sling it bro cap Not that kind of rope bro You're exactly right, MIA3D. Poor, fat chicks are always insecure and that's why they love Ulta and Sephora. They think buying expensive makeup will make them look better, but it never does. These stores prey on the insecurities of poor women and I think it's disgusting. One word. Starts with ‚ÄúS‚Äù ends with ‚ÄúT‚Äù ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259) It really is, makes you feel cheap Zach, The hero WSB needed Tell that to everyone still buying S&P calls They are. My anus has never been cleaner. [deleted] Share buybacks would have been a better use of the capital than buying 10y bonds that yielded dick all. I will figure it out I always do Deal I will print them all out since 2017 and give them to you How do I do that hey dude ile you please just dump the market for a straight got tomorrow so I can fucking sell my tesla and nvidia puts and qqq puts please?

Can you dry it for me? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258) CJ_2013, I couldn't agree more. Poor people are too dumb and stubborn to accept defeat. They get high on copium and continue to revenge buy puts, which only leads them further down the spiral of poverty. I know where you can put it ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275) They literally just covered it five minutes ago on The Nightly News with Lester Holt. It was at the top of r/all the other day. If you don‚Äôt mind getting my ankles too that would be great Amazing job man! Im alsoo a broke college boy who gained 3k by doing this On it! You got their number? Does it not regulate itself? On the blockchain? Regulation is the only path forward for BTC It tanked for no reason at all. The SEC is still trying to fight bitcoin, which is a fight they will lose just like every other government or related institution in the past. Don't tell anyone..but a sell-off is coming tomorrow I also felt the euphoria lol. Also, quad witching tomorrow Say that to my nvda puts,  nerd I wasn‚Äôt a pussy when I bought everything in February 2021.

Not rocket science. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31125) ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) Yes, I saw the pre-market activity this morning. The poor fools were panicking and selling off their positions. It was quite amusing to watch. *Flips the spooge into Mom's eye 0.5 seconds later to teach her for entering without knocking.* No *Dont tell me, how to live my life* Gud idea homie. Than ks Assuming you got enough to pay your annual dues Yep. It's happening. I was bagholding 3.5k shares at 13.12 but I grabbed 8k in calls in May and another 3k in Calls today for 7/7 A lot of room to get back there I'd think I'll wash them for you king Power bottom ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882) im switch for guys.  hot AF  when a skinny boy like me dominates a dude ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882) yep, price moving sharply ITM to either side while IV rises = ![img](emote|t5_2th52|29637) Yeah it whips He meant me LOL. Good one. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189) Hell naw Nah not in a bad way I SWEAR ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258) It sucks to be old and unable to perform like you used to. Enjoy your youth while you can because it won't last forever. Al Pacino is 83 and still putting out man chowder Waiting for puts to print Their rates are still lower than the US. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) It's not even an AI company. Just a tech company. But every fucking tech company is somehow an AI company now ok bro ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189) I left like 1k on the table with 443c ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260) ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258) it will go to 1000 tomorrow whats going on with avgo ?

The Antichrist has to claim to be the Jewish Messiah and is therefore going to be a Jew.

Don't worry, most Jews know this still, so he won't come anytime soon because they're not that dumb. What about sqqq calls ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787) ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) It‚Äôs gonna be an all day kind of event homie. I have a beautiful wife in my life, she also puts up with my Palantir discussion. Little more lately then normal‚Ä¶ when you understand it, you understand it The bear doesn't have logic or reasoning. He only takes L's and will continue to do so. He ain't wrong bro the fuckin market is wrong It's German dummy Yass hoffentlich Is my 23/06 10c safe ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260) holding over weekend sounds like a bad idea too ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27421) agree, although kinda preferred the market action when they were in their containment market.  this ai rip is another nft. He's more of a e-scooter type Lol fighting Nvidia is like fighting a pack of angry men with down syndrome while having your hands tied behind your back.

I would go all in on calls but I sure as hell am hesitant to buy more than a single short dated put. Means our outs are guaranteed to print!!! It‚Äôs basically in the bay with the futes being dark red and all. Lmao ![img](emote|t5_2th52|30641) Make sure to close your positions before report Oh they started big time QE and thats saying alot ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259) Own it bro! But certainly green by close Yeah I was just joking I never actually studied economics in college but actually good point but I think goal is to get inflation down to 2%, and it‚Äôs at 4% so we‚Äôre almost there Eat my dongus you fuckin nerd.

Get in now Preach VisualMod! Expose this scammer. thats why you're poor, bot slave True but it can still continue if lots of contracts were rolled past this expiration and there was enough call buying volume past this expiration to imply more gamma hedging. Provide a service to someone I figure like me job, currently behind Wendy's ... If you want to gamble, you should at least know what you‚Äôre betting on He meant the truck Lmao load up for tmmr I‚Äôm 9k shares in this is bout to be next game stop Ignore it or laugh it doesn‚Äôt change the facts A few? Have you seen the OI and volume on the 1dte 600c lmao They're going hard in the paint against DoorDash and the CEOs compensation package kicks in at $80+ nobody gives a fuck about any bad news with it. 

They announced UberBoat, UberYacht is next. Few. I didn't notice it until today. Me as well. Wish I kept an eye out earlier. May be worth holding onto for a little.  https://www.nikolamotor.com/stockholder-meeting/ Save this post when your puts will print tomorrow. It‚Äôs guaranteed! There is no way in this world that the market will some how turn green. It‚Äôs basically in the bag. üôÑ I really hope so man. Watching spce take off tomorrow is gonna kill my soul... I thought aliens buy spce but then was like no that's regarded and then bam 2 days later they drop bomb shell news and it rockets... fuck me dude Fuck it ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883) I know. Rub it in why dont you ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189) You‚Äôre a robot so that makes sense. Just had two stare into my store, one audibly says ‚Äúoh hey lets go talk to him‚Äù before they come in, don‚Äôt talk to me and be all passive the whole time i tried to talk to them about our product, and then they silently amble around for like 2 minutes before awkwardly leaving. I have no problems getting women‚Äôs attention. 

But man do a lot of them suck at flirting. Refer to my other comment here for an example. ex perma-bull, now a swinger kangaroo currently on my puts side where‚Äôs the funny 

try again All the days gains gone No, I have them set for the 20th ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260) As soon as I hit ""buy"" the ship sank. Fingers crossed for another huge pump tomorrow Frfr Same problem. You run out of cash to trade and have to wait for your cash to settle. QQQ 6/23 470 puts. Will sell them once the Q‚Äôs pull back to the low 360‚Äôs :D Makes sense Thank you. How can we determine the change in the iv? To own the charging stations, similar to the Tesla deal And I just meant the proverbial ford, could be any giant corp name checks out This is also a weird post and you should be banned for thinking of kids being touched Last Fri was.up for the day and closed down in Neg. for all large 7 tech stocks,  except TSLA.
Im not saying it will apply this pumping market,  but technically QQQ overbought I have puts The circle of bag holders it's a beautiful thing üòÇ Take your bad vibes elsewhere. Palantir is a different animal today. We are profitable MFer It‚Äôs a 1 year contract adding 10% revenue to the top line. The difference between selling software and selling cars is the software has an 80% gross margin. Also Gov revenue is extremely sticky and they tend to spend even more the next year to extend. Learn something new everyday don‚Äôt ya? I don't have any position either. There are free programs that do what photoshop does. garbo company LMAO maybe learn to read charts ü§å Theta LMAO ü§å Nvda fair value price is 2k Now they are getting a taste of their own medicine ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267) üòòüòò I compared the rhetoric of the two central banks genius What country you in, cuz that's not possible in merica What is your win rate vm Stoopid, it is that price. Gah damn cheat Dis de wey I believe it is a shorts squeeze to avoid the stock going down below $1 to be delisted from NASDAQ  
The board might have to reverse split shares to hold the $1 value.  
But probably the executive change is there as well. U hate money lmao It isn‚Äôt immoral when the suffering is justified. 

If it‚Äôs a just outcome, then it‚Äôs the right thing to happen, whatever that might be.

Buls are evil as their greed precedes everything and everyone. Sounds like you been talking to bears Solid strat ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258) I‚Äôm a regard IV means nothing Shorts are fuckkkkkkked Gonna decalcify the shit out of it starting now Who said I wasn't? old people, ALWAYS telling us what to do. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640) Even if you have money, why would you just sit and watch it evaporate?

Tomorrow Just open up the TLRY all time chart and look at what it did after IPO. It was also very low float initially. How dare you tell me to sell the news, I was expecting to jump the ship on the very last day. /s I had 6/23 485c, 6/23 500c, and 6/23 505c. made at least 100% on each so I can‚Äôt complain but still hurts. Id just rather short amd or another company 10k in calls and 3.5k shares Yolo Ya buy iv Agreed, will hold If you haven't noticed, this rally is not based on fundamentals

It's a multiples expansion rally

Either way though, fundamentals don't matter, never have never will fundamentals done matter anymore Idk I‚Äôm just talking shit. I doubt those fucks will do anything. There was a huge thing when the new chair came in saying ‚Äúhe‚Äôs going to lift the ultra loose monetary policy‚Äù but he‚Äôs prob too pussy to do anything.

Salespeople are often motivated by commissions, which means they may be more likely to offer a lower price if they know another salesperson could get the sale instead. However, it's also important to remember that every situation is different, so there's no guarantee that this will always be the case.

Go on Amazon and buy bacteriostatic water, you'll also want 30g 1ml insulin syringes with 8mm needle. 

Fill a syringe with 1ml bacteriostatic water, slowly inject it into your dry hgh vial then slowly roll the vial until all the powder dissolves, don't shake it. Dont fill more than one or two vials at a time, store everything in the fridge. 

Since you used 1ml for a 10iu vial, 0.1ml = 1iu. Inject subcutaneously. 

I started with 2 iu/day and went up to 3iu after a few weeks to avoid any sides from ramping too quickly.

Whistleblower? There never was a whistleblower Yes Please ban zachjsrf Reddit. He smells like a used taco I use reddit on the desktop mainly when i'm at work or home. so until they kill old reddit i'll still use it. but I'll probably just never use it again on my phone. I rarely do anyways since my account was banned and I don't want to wipe my phones history. i'll deal with it when I need to search things I guess. but certainly will not create an account. I have no idea tbh. It's going to take literally 3 times as long for me to browse through the same information I want to see from reddit daily. I'll probably just use reddit way less or only desktop old.reddit version, although I hear that could go away with the api changes as well. I'm just amazed it has lasted this long. I‚Äôm still trying to figure out why my Napster isn‚Äôt working anymore He needs it. Boi‚Äôs soft af Been cross referencing past instances with similar rates of inflation and fed rate. When inflation rises, so does gold and fed rates. When it cools, gold plummets.

I was trying to find a good play for July's (June) CPI release. Very likely it will be cool. 

Just did the cross referencing tonight, going to do some actual research in the coming weeks. No shit. Season 6 is out? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|19738) Episode felt like a celebrity circle jerk lol Let‚Äôs do it are you located near CA That‚Äôs not the Texas flag I don't understand this. 

Say you have $100 and you buy 10 shares of a stock for $10 each. You buy right before the ex-dividend date so it pays out a $1 dividend. So you get $10 back and you now have $90 worth of stock. 

Or you could wait until after the ex-dividend date and buy 10 shares for $9 each. You'd then have $90 of stock and $10 of cash. You're in exactly the same position as before.

So what's the point? Are you hoping to be the first person to dump the stock right after the dividend comes out? If you can buy for $10 before the ex-dividend date (millisecond) and sell for $9.50, you'd come out $5 ahead. You get the $1 dividend and you managed to sell to some poor sucker who mistakenly overpaid for a $9 stock.

Or maybe there's some kind of tax loophole? If you pay $9 for stock, your cost basis is $9/share. If you pay $10 for stock and get a $1 dividend, you'd have to pay short term taxes on the dividend. But then your cost basis is $10/share. This doesn't sound like it would lower your taxes though. If anything I think it would increase them slightly. Dividends are a cheat code for long term success, and it will always beat day trading. I had a great teacher ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883) it is not about the status quo but what is to come.

I would say tomorrow it will be around 63-65.00 if ADBE opens at 508. Beyond that that point the extrinsic value is baked in, I would sell. no why? most countries use day/month/year.

If it pumps tomorrow, I‚Äôm selling everything by close to enjoy my weekend without any open positions. We need a quad witching blow off top Yup. You only can trade with settled cash. No instant deposits. Options settle overnight. So if you enter a trade and exit you can't trade right away with those funds. Gotta wait till the next day.

Do you um.... have a single daughter that is 18 or older? Look at same strike the week after, that is typically about the expectation‚Ä¶ if your ADBE 550 was 200% IV and next week‚Äôs only 85%, ciao‚Ä¶ Look at the IV, then look again later and write them down. Also, Vega is the amount per share that a contract will move per percentage point of IV American car manufacturers have said repeatedly they ain't interested in that.

Profit is profit Pretty ghey Oh wow, you just made my day - might move everything out of Robinhood and go all in on Fidelity actually ü§î * Best app: super simple and clean
* Commission free trades on everything including stocks, ETFs, options, and crypto
* 1% match on 401k and IRA transfers/contributions
* High interest rate on cash with Robinhood Gold.
* $1.5 million of FDIC insurance instead of usual $250,000 (they sweep to multiple bank accounts instead of one)
* Fractional shares
* Automated investing in ETFs
* 24 hour trading in major stocks and ETFs
* Frequent improvements
* No incentives to push you to their bank/investment funds/financial advisors since they don‚Äôt have any of those things.
* They make money by selling our order flow to market makers in bulk. It‚Äôs business model is similar to Costco. It‚Äôs good for retail investors, and not so good for institutions. But pretty much all the brokers do this now (except Fidelity and Vanguard, which have their own internal market makers.)

Also, all the other brokers have had various problems lately. Robinhood had a bunch of problems a few years ago (everyone here knows this is a major understatement.) But they‚Äôve mostly fixed them by now. This is an ultra competitive industry so it pays to switch around to whoever is the best at a given time. I‚Äôm regularly amazed at how cheap and easy investing has become. I mean, we used to pay huge commissions to trade until Robinhood cut them to $0. It‚Äôs nuts. I‚Äôm a big fan of Jack Bogle, and I see Robinhood as a spiritual successor when it comes to cost cutting. Vanguard funds are still the best, but they‚Äôve basically exited the retail brokerage business. Not a problem because Robinhood recommends Vanguard and other dirt cheap index funds in its portfolio recommendation tool.

The only downside is that the customer service is weak. TDA/Schwab has the best. Fidelity is above average. Robinhood‚Äôs is the worst. But it‚Äôs simple enough that you don‚Äôt need much help. Robinhood keeps costs low by hiring fewer human customer service folks. I don‚Äôt mind the trade off, because I can always come here for help. don't exaggerate or we might end up with the first green quad witching day of the last 4 years Puts are on life support, pull the plug. If you‚Äôre trying to time the dip to sell your puts AND get calls you‚Äôll likely miss both. If you exit puts too early on the way down then that‚Äôs better because you can still ride the calls up. If you wait and manage to time the puts at the bottom then you‚Äôll miss the calls on the way up and could likely miss the right time for both puts and calls. Do you mean it or trying to tell me this is what happens if you buy puts? I hate how  I found that hot yeah i know You‚Äôre in the land of mountains‚Ä¶. Where is that üòü Daddy Elon is our God. hmm, not as much as i hoped for They aren‚Äôt real psilocybin is the issue. They‚Äôre research chems.

Waiting after the ex dividend date, you‚Äôd have to wait until the next quarter to receive a dividend That's a really dumb way of thinking about things.

I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if you see one of them again. Last time I checked about 80% of shares are in the green maybe most that lost sold out. I for one averaged down to a single digit cost basis and am considering averaging up now it's also connected to the amount of cash in T's that institutions in the US have been holding, they are the ones pushing this and it will keep going. obviously they are connected in some fashion, but to assume you can deploy the same strategy for exchanges is regarded. it's called momentum trading

buy puts after big consecutive green days and buy calls after big consecutive red days

literally free money You don‚Äôt know how old I am but my parents will never understand Reddit and if they tried it would kill them That's okay. We can make it work The lower the number the better, if it makes u cringe or have to ask, it's too many. How many times you tried catching a falling a knife? This is like that but in reverse. Honestly not a bad trade. At these levels. If we go higher the correction be bigger or we will have to trade sideways for longer. It wouldnt be a bad idea to confirm a change of trend before putting this trade on because of the magnitude of momentum we have seen it could go higher. With opex tomorrow we could see a temporary end to the rally as early as tomorrow or next week. The golden rule is 45dte and manage at 21 but if you have conviction that the trend is over you can increase your trade turn over and profit percentage by doing 21dte and holding until expiration. Just know that closer you get to exp. The greater your gamma risk so large swings in option prices can take a winning trades profits out quickly. As long as you are far enough otm you can ride these out and theta decay will over ride all else leading into expiration. What I like about Fidelity is that I automatically get a return on my uninvested funds without a subscription like Robinhood requires. I never go full port, only about 10% of my port‚Äôs value per trade, so I always have funds just sitting there doing nothing You have a PDT designation on a Robinhood account? When's the last time you checked? PDT designations expire after 90 days at Robinhood so it might be gone by now. What time are you buying calls tomorrow? If I had to guess that‚Äôs when the market will drop. Not that it always happens like that or anything‚Ä¶ Ok fuck you too Oh word, I assume you mean Colorado then. That‚Äôs pretty cool I completely agree that the 200-220 range is the sweet spot for buying and selling. Anything under 210 is a buy, in my opinion.

The world may never know Fr![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882) [deleted] If you want to go semantics we can go semantics. Oxford voluntary definition-done, given, or acting of one's own free will. If I presented you with a ‚Äúchoice‚Äù and option 1. was accept my offer. Option 2. Is decline my offer and you lose your job, family, healthcare, and pretty much anything else in your life. You are being coerced into a choice, which defies the free-will we outlined in the definition of voluntary Year doesn‚Äôt matter here. Yeah I caught you cuz you said 30/6 not 6/30 Hope you filled one out. And at this point it's either shit or short but now I don't trust you ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27421) Verb is also a word and I said ‚Äúwhat to do‚Äù‚Ä¶never mind bro. You don‚Äôt need to do anything I will not touch your anoos! I mean if I'm being honest with myself yeah, but in the past I have had women dominate me and I used to find it hot üëÄ can they grow another 8% the other 364 days of the year to beat guidance of 18% YoY? ü§î I only put in what I'm cool with loosing. Just throw $300 at it. If it starts to go bad, I'll sell. I don't understand how people aren't setting alerts and shit You're probably right, I'll just have to work on my one liners. There is no doubt that the US stock market is connected to the amount of cash that institutions have been holding. However, it is important to remember that each exchange operates differently, so it is not advisable to blindly apply the same strategy across all exchanges. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) How many days of consecutive before you buy the counter trend play I'm definitely older. 41 Not a Pull out couch...get it? Maybe you missed that on the front page of Reddit. ""Have to ask"" 
How would you even know? Hence waiting for trend change confirmation would be the smart decision if op has the patience. And thankfully selling premium you have the benefit of rolling to buy yourself more time Personally, I use SPY as my default position and never keep cash either. I sell SPY and buy the position that I want, then sell and buy SPY when I‚Äôm done. I trade in a Roth IRA to avoid short term capital gains taxes. If I wanted cash as my default, I‚Äôd use SGOV or a similar fund as my default position. It‚Äôs like an ETF version of a money market fund. Both Robinhood and Fidelity allow for fractional shares. So you can just buy and sell in dollar amounts.

Robinhood‚Äôs advantage is that their cash core account is FDIC insured up to $1.5 million and has a high rate with Robinhood Gold. But I‚Äôm not worried about the safety of Fidelity money market funds. 

I like Schwab/TDA, but they‚Äôre a scam on this front. And IBKR is infuriatingly scammy. Their ads promise a high interest rate on uninvested cash, but they neglect to tell you in the ad that it‚Äôs a 0% rate on the first $10,000 of cash, then a high rate afterwards. 5% of $10,000 is $500/year. That missing interest income is way more than Robinhood Gold‚Äôs $60/year.

So I think you‚Äôre doing the right thing by holding cash in Fidelity‚Äôs money market fund. It‚Äôs not as good as Vanguard‚Äôs but it‚Äôs pretty good. If you‚Äôre gonna use a taxable account at Robinhood without Robinhood Gold, I‚Äôd use Ally or another HYSA to hold your cash. The only other thing to consider is Robinhood‚Äôs 1% match on IRA and 401k transfers and contributions. That‚Äôs an insane deal. 

Personally, I have accounts at Fidelity, TDA, Schwab, and Robinhood. They all have different deals/advantages so I go wherever the best deal is at a given time. I‚Äôve been keeping my cash at Fidelity, but soon HYSA‚Äôs will start paying more than money market funds so I‚Äôll transfer my cash back to Ally (the best bank, in my opinion.) i dont know man, i dont have an account with them yet I always time it perfectly, as soon as i get calls it drops, literally the instant I do, opposite for puts Yeah friends gone. Gotta make new ones. To Valhalla together brother, ride or die sqqq losers ü´° This just makes me nervous man. I have all long positions, but I started buying some puts on things I think have gotten way ahead of themselves. Yes, I am still doing the super secret Reddit crush thing. The world may never know what goes on in my mind, but that's just how I like it. My super secret reddit crush knows ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275) 06/30 Tesla 225p (10 puts)

I use old reddit. so dunno what emoji that should be. will keep averaging down Yeah okay you win Lol I sure did. There will be no pulling out Oh, yeah I don't go to many other places on Reddit Have to ask someone if it's too many, like u go to a friend and ask oh so n sos got 15 bodies, is it too much. If u have to ask its too many But then you miss out on the favorable skew possibly. Once trend has reversed so has skew and all most of the juice. I‚Äôd rather do the trade and cut it if trend shows signs of continuation. Good food for thought, back to the drawing board. Thanks boys appreciate it. I know this is a place for degenerates but honestly thank you, I learned a lot and am definitely going to explore what you said. Still new to trading in general, made some good/lucky decisions along with some abysmal choices that cost me thousands. Doing my best to learn from every mistake and making smarter decisions. I‚Äôve managed to make +$5,000 now from a starting account of $9,000 in the past couple weeks by making some long term plays coupled with a few day trades occasionally.

I also lost -99% on a GameStop call, taught me to never invest in meme stocks again regardless of the hype. I only go after reputable companies I know and trust now, and you‚Äôre complete right about SPY. Been thinking lately how long term calls on SPY - maybe 2 weeks to a month - could be the best play as my main bet given how stable it is known to be. My main play is taking smaller but more predictable gains over reaching for the wild swings (I did bet on a high swing with ADBE today though üëÄ - I still need to work on this). Think I‚Äôll take that approach start of next week based off how we start off! You have to day trade 4 times in a week to get a pattern day trader designation. If you have one at another brokerage, it wouldn't transfer over to Robinhood.

[deleted] You‚Äôre getting robbed at gunpoint. You refuse to give your wallet. You have now been shot in the leg. You had the option to give the mugger your wallet so you have been voluntarily shot in the leg. The bullet in your leg is a consequence of your decision not to hand over your wallet. This is what voluntary looks like from your point of view Are those countries in Schengen region? Can I start after market closes on weekdays? Then you shall be forever alone ![img](emote|t5_2th52|30663) Hmm is it really that obvious? Rest assured, I will hold you to that. See? Isn't this better than comments about sharting and shooping? She might be telling me the truth with her 3 answer. Idk If you‚Äôre expecting 2-3% correction I‚Äôd suggest a put calendar spread. Benefits from rise in vega, theta positive. Calendar spreads don‚Äôt get enough love. You're welcome, enjoy your poverty. If you want to learn how to invest for real, go to Bogleheads.org or /r/bogleheads.

https://freakonomics.com/podcast/the-stupidest-thing-you-can-do-with-your-money/ One in Japan one in Vermont. I will say my biggest regret was buying the dip not as aggressively as I should have. I'm up huge percentage wise but I'm still sitting on way to much cash. And I have such a good cost basis on somethings I don't want to take profits, because I don't think we'll see those prices again. (Ie amazon at $85) So im buying puts to hedge so I'll have even more cash to buy a pullback more aggressively. Because I'm a bear disguised as a bull to get into parties ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787) I am out to have to roll these to later dates, at least my tesla puts Ooh we‚Äôre doing metaphors that aren‚Äôt even close to relevant? My turn

You‚Äôre an autistic 37 year old with poor personal hygiene. You refuse to bathe. You‚Äôve now been rejected by all women you encounter because of the horrible smell emanating from you. The social rejection is a consequence for your refusal to participate in activities society at large seems required. no. never been to europeen. No, you. Dual evidence, bro: words and deeds. I cant wait Lol I haven't really looked at the daily thread today. Sounds like I didn't miss much Thats a good plan my bro, yeah I regret not going all in when Google was at 90 Bro what? Being socially rejected and being denied basic human necessities are not at all comparable. A bullet in the leg represents at least a comparable concept because you are either sacrificing your money or putting your health at risk. A gun in your face and the adverse effects of a vaccine are not the same magnitude at all, but the concept is comparable ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)![img](emote|t5_2th52|31125) Soon Dude same. My cost is $99 but it went down into the 80s around the same time as Amazon I belive Idk I like the bronze bool ![img](emote|t5_2th52|29637) ‚ÄúAdverse effects of the vaccine‚Äù lmao and there we go. That‚Äôs what the real issue is - you believe that Nice bro! It‚Äôs kinda scary There are adverse effects of the vaccine. The CDC will tell you that. That is a fact. I‚Äôm not a crazy person saying taking a vaccine will kill you. Most people will be completely fine after. But there are adverse effects that vary between people. That‚Äôs not arguable Thanks man! I hope you keep making money bro! How about the bat? What‚Äôs not arguable is that the extremely minimal adverse effects are far preferable to getting the virus itself Thanks bro, you too! I like that but make your eyes a different color Definitely this one I never argued that. While I haven‚Äôt read a specific study regarding that I would agree with you. That still does not justify the mandates. You‚Äôre something like 10x more likely to die on a motorcycle than a car. People can still ride motorcycles. As a matter of fact, your life expectancy would probably increase by quite a bit if you never road in any vehicular transport at all. You can still drive your car I went with one of my old looks whatcha think? Ok, then that's my avatar from now on ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|flushed) Again, bad comparison. You being irresponsible about being vaccinated for transmissible illnesses can directly negatively impact others around you. You can get others killed just by coming into contact with them. 

You deciding to drive a motorcycle largely only affects you Fucking love it The vaccine‚Äôs main benefit was reducing the severity of illness of the vaccinated individual. As more information came out the likelihood that the vaccine significantly lowered transmission became doubtful. Although, yes, it does lower transmission to some degree. Regardless of this, my point about risk still stands. You cannot coerce people into every decision that is deemed to be ‚Äúsafest for society‚Äù."
