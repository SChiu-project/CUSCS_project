Just listing reasons why bears won’t be having a good time tomorrow lmao I didn’t know what to wear to my premature ejaculation meeting

So I just came in my pants One of my best decisions in life was convincing my grandma to buy 3000$ of apple stock in 2009 when I was in middle school. My mom still has it for me ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face) Let Tim Cook Can’t believe Ron DeSantis is going to lose the primary and become just another Florida guy who gets his nuts bitten off by an alligator at a golf course.

If this is not a sign that no recession is coming, I don't know what is 🤷‍♂️ #BREAKING: AAPL ANNOUNCE OFFER TO BUY THE WHOLE S&P500

🚨 🚨 🚨 Apple is 0.69% away from $3T ![img](emote|t5_2th52|18632) I never told my son I sold the 3000 dollars in apple stock when mom died to pay for her funeral. So many pressed bears in here today. I thought y’all were supposed to be rational and avoid trading on emotion? The markets closed. Y’all need to stfu and start making out with each other. Did someone say cock fight?

#🧐🫴🍆 That cute little end of day SPY pump made me $7k. Over 2 months of my pay made in less than 15 mins. God bless America ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276) #Pro tip



If you raise taxes on the poor it will scare them into working harder and becoming rich, I've just solved poverty Does anyone remember the good old days during Covid apple at 190.50 in Europe right now

my puts are dead imagine holding puts all day or through any portion of the day longer than like 15 minutes. all the emotional ups and downs and what-ifs and when all the dust settles its nothing but higher lows as far as the eye can see $AAPL is going to fist you bears elbow deep One of my best memories in my life is when my realtor asked me ""what I did for a living"" when I was doing the final walk thru on my house. I casually said I'm unemployed and he looked at me like I was crazy NKE bears were jizzing on themselves for about 1.5 minutes...just like their sex lives, it was short lived and disappointing looking at stocks on robinhood is like being a kid high on sugar You wanna see? Shouldbe went on the DIS cruise with my family but instead I stayed home and lost 10k. Fml Gn regards ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31226) LMAO 🤌 I took a break for 2 years only to come back and lose $1500 in two weeks. I have a problem. Nike CEO during earnings call probably:

This Bull market has been rough on this ole Bear. If I keep losing money I might have to start doing YouTube Pranks in the Hood videos. I don’t wanna die guys 🥺 Meeting this girl called Lettucia tonight #I LOVE MEN COCK Bear speak: “You obviously don’t know how the market works” 

Translation: “I know I’ve been wrong for the last 6 months but I read this article today and it had a graph that went down.” My wife probably thinks I’m chatting with other women when I keep checking my phone but I’m really reading JPow erotica The first time I had sex was sad. I was 17 and all my friends already lost their virginity. I got a girlfriend and she had already had 1 partner prior. I basically tried having sex with her constantly and she wanted it to be “special” so she always turned it down. She surprised me on my birthday and had sex with me. She just rode on top for 10 seconds, I busted, I said “thank you”, and then it was just awkward for an hour / half (we finished pirates of the Caribbean’s Deadman’s Chest..), then I drove home. 

We stayed together for 6-7 months longer and at that point I was just 5 second banging her a lot. We broke up cause she cheated on me and then I started doing drugs cause I was depressed. 

Man being a teenager sucks. I hope my sons are cooler then me. TSLA SQUEEZE AGAIN🚀🚀🚀 RECORD EARNINGS 🚀🚀🚀 That SPY melt up day is cumming to finish the week

you need to understand, that the market is trying to fuk you, if you had bought NVDA at the bottom, it would not be over $400 right, it would be around $10

it being over $400 is the direct result of you not buying it, so dont beat yourself up for missing the boat, because the boat will sink the moment you jump on no matter the price

hope this helps Every girl I’ve met who drives a jeep wrangler is a huge cunt AAPL very undervalue stonk ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189) AAPL got a massive analyst upgrade with a $240 PT.

Institutions want the rally to keep going. AAPL $200 next week really wanna get a job but i dont wanna work for $18 an hour wtf do I do ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31225) #🅱️enis 😮‍💨👌 Crying so the girls will leave the bar and then me and the boys have more room to play army hello fellow socially awkward redditors ,  i am  back once again to plead with you to free pizza rat Since JPM collar is gonna come up tomorrow a lot here is how to calculate it.

Let’s say reference point is 4400

They will buy puts at 5% - 4180

They will sell puts at 20% - 3520

To fund this debit put spread they will sell calls probably around 5-7%.  Let’s assume 5% - 4620.

Then a bunch of other institutions will shadow trade this collar.

Then collar will get settled around +/- 5 points EoD. About to watch The Witcher hoping they show Henry Cavil nekked. Wen bath tub scene? some of you have never watched women swimming in the pool with binoculars from your house and it shows My overtime is 200 dollars an hour.

My friend said me and another friend could stay at his dads second house in town. The house was 2 stories tall and it had running water + electricity. We didn’t think anything of it cause we trusted him, so we stayed there for a week. We just invited girls over and hooked up a PlayStation in the living room. It was awesome cause we were just punk kids. 

Anyway Friday morning the cops showed up at 6am. They knocked on the door and were asking why we were in the house. My friend ran out the front door while I was talking to them and they both left me alone to chase him. My dumbass tried running to my car, but I changed my mind halfway and walked back. The cop came running around the corner of the house with his taser out, pointing it at me, and screaming “GET ON THE GROUND!”. I went to the ground and the cop said I was evading. I told him we had permission to be at the house from one of our friends and he told me the house was foreclosed on months ago.  

I ended up getting charged with Criminal mischief, trespassing, burglary, and evading a police officer. I went to court and they dropped everything except the trespassing, but since I was originally charged with a felony that means I had to do felony probation. 

For felony probation I had to have a full-time job with no community service or do 100 hours of community service and have a part-time job.

I ended up working at Arby’s part-time (I got fired and that’s a funny story, but I’ll save that for another time). [deleted] I was a 🐻 during the banking crisis & then I realized something life changing ...

Green all day everyday If Europoors don’t buy up futures after what we did for them during WW2 I will never forgive them Like 7 years ago i was working in a club as bar back and there was this hilarious bartender dude that always got his snacks stolen by the staff so he decided to give us a lesson and he brought teddy bears in a bag, he left it there on the counter during open and it didn’t took long before like what he tought would be half the staff started to steal some. Just before we let people in he rang the shot bell and asked everyone to come for the opening meeting. 

He went: 
- Well guys some of you are indeed fucked, this is a bag of sweets and about 1 in 5 is a weed gummy, there is less than half left so tonight there is at least one of you mf that will be trippin balls!

So almost nobody really reacted, and he was like so who tf is sweating rn? Little did he know i was the one that ate like half the bag, alone!!

🤾 All my shoes are Nike I don’t understand 📉 For those holding NKE calls. I spoke with Michael Jordan. Incoming recovery. YW. Slap my balls! Drunk af but happy af I didn't touch SPCE. This market actually feels like 2020 That spce move was way too easy That eps decline over the last 5 quarters is scary for nike #IM A FAN OF TESLA I’m too poor to exercise so WeBull forced me to sell my 437 calls at 3:48pm about 60 seconds before the hulk dick AMA I have bought the top, and sold the bottom in almost 70% of my trades the last 2 months.

The next few weeks are going to be out of control Since the topic seems to be crazy black swan events, here's one that could really possibly happen:

The earth could fart and kill much of Asia.

No, seriously. The Siberian tundra has about 180 billion metric tons of carbon and a similarly sizeable body of sequestered methane. If it were all or a lot of it to be released through the accumulated melting of permafrost at once, the result would be massive oxygen displacement. And before you say this is impossible, it's happened on smaller scales in other places, thinking specifically at the moment about the Lake Nyos disaster.

There's your black swan... the earth farts, and Asia gets to breath it in. #Pro tip

https://www.wsj.com/articles/robinhood-was-behind-phantom-surge-in-berkshire-hathaway-trade-volume-study-finds-11658309401 The thing with weed stocks is really an equation of supply and demand. The bigger the supply the less demand, and the price per OZ drops drastically. In my area an ounce from a dispensary used to be 480. Now you can get it for less than 150. The reason for that is multiple dispensaries opened up in the area and the supply outgrew the demand. In response they cut the prices to gain the business, which caused others to do the same, and it was a race to the bottom. At the end of the day its a plant and it really shouldnt be more than like 100 an oz. As it gets legalized more and more it will go lower and lower. STAY AWAY FROM WEED STOCKS.

First of all, the API he was using was free, unheard of

Next the developer in question is not personally losing money but rather returning funds for an unfulfilled service.

Next, the developer possesses strong software development skills but lacks social, business, and negotiation abilities (Narwhal has negotiated with Reddit)

Finally the developer's failure to seek assistance in monetizing their app, instead resorting to actions that may mislead customers.

I’m not shitting on the chicken at all cause it taste phenomenal. The problem I have with it is the price and small portion sizes. 

I’ll order a 12pc count with sweet and spicy Siracha sauce + Chik-Fil-A sauce, Large with a coke (you gotta try the Siracha sauce if you haven’t. It’s fucking amazing). 

It’ll cost around $12 dollars and those damn waffle fries take up so much space that you only get like 10 of them if you’re lucky. The nuggets satisfy my taste buds but they don’t fill me up. It’s overpriced and the portion sizes are = to a fancy dinner plate. Like bitch y’all are a fast food place. For that reason I’ll never say they are the best chicken place.

Since 2000, there were 14 cases of quarters with at or below 2% real GDP growth which did not precede a recession in the next quarter. Also, 2% real GDP growth annualized is 8% real GDP growth which is above the benchmark.

Upper end of society actually hates you Jerome Powell is a married man and y’all need to put your cocks away. It’s making WSB look like neanderthals. We don’t need to be bringing up his deep voice, or masculine broad shoulders, and his thick veiny arms while he talks sweet nothings in to his microphone on TV, or the way he struts out of the office with his fat juicy ass chafing in that sexy suit. 

God damn I wish he would talk everyday.. MODS I want a perma ban.  Send the pain. There I am, sitting on the park bench, legs crossed, head in my hand, scrolling mindlessly on my day’s instagram feed. I just got my hair done to make myself feel a little better after my bf broke up with me last week. I think about how amazing it would be if I could just have one night, just one, with Jerome Powell. All of a sudden, an older skinny white man with a newspaper adjusts his glasses and turns the page. I see the headline: “Jerome Powell announces federal reserve interest rate hike: What you need to know” my mind goes to a dark place for a second, before I continue to scroll as if nothing happened. 

Two days later, I’m at the grocery store. An older white man approaches me. He seems familiar. “His ass really is fuckable, huh?” He asks me sarcastically. The only reply I can muster is, “11.75”. Who here has had anal sex and enjoyed it?

Recently, Wendover Productions has been creating videos that deliberately provoke anger. One of his latest videos, titled ""Revolt Against the US Dollar,"" discusses how several countries, including Russia, China, Brazil, India, and South Africa, are unhappy with the US for cutting off trade with Russia after the Ukraine war.

As a response, these countries are attempting to establish their own global currency. However, there are two significant issues. Firstly, these countries have existing conflicts and tensions among themselves. Secondly, their currencies lack stability and trustworthiness.

It seems likely that Wendover Productions created this video to generate attention and encourage comments criticizing the idea as foolish.

Plenty of cash through 2024 at which point should become cash flow positive… about to announce another car at price point where real volume can start (factory finally pumping out cars and could reliever against a lower priced vehicle), trading relatively low in comparison to growth opportunity.  2.5x future revenue.

Buying more GS considering it’s trading slight above book.  More focused on technical strength to get back to 330-340 in a short period (2 wks).

Everything else would be relatively boring for Reddit (jepq, defense, industrials).  Selling nvda and buying reverse.

I just got my hair done to make myself feel a little better after my bf broke up with me last week. I think about how amazing it would be if I could just have one night, just one, with Jerome Powell. All of a sudden, an older skinny white man with a newspaper adjusts his glasses and turns the page. I see the headline: “Jerome Powell announces federal reserve interest rate hike: What you need to know” my mind goes to a dark place for a second, before I continue to scroll as if nothing happened. 

Two days later, I’m at the grocery store. An older white man approaches me. He seems familiar. “His ass really is fuckable, huh?” He asks me sarcastically. The only reply I can muster is, “11.75”.

You can’t say stocks. We are lulu SPX 4455C for tomorrow costs only $50 just saying Never anticipated SPY $440 like I do for tomorrow Apple is gonna hit 3.5 trillion soon. Why? It’s simple. The Apple Vision Pro costs $3499 and they’re going to sell a billion of them. As a software company, the marginal cost per goggle is $0. So they’ll make $3.5 trillion. That makes them the second most valuable country in the world after California itself. Big PP’s are too overrated If she's above a 7, she's a scammer. 
CVNA 25.91 - 56% short; ratio 1.00 consistently low
AI 35.80 - 35% short; ratio 1.00 low since Dec
FSR 5.43 - 35% short; ratio 7.88 high since March
LAZR 6.76 - 26% short; ratio 7.79 fluctuating rising
MVIS 4 .00 - 26% short; ratio 2.98 rapidly falling
KSS 23.09 - 22% short; ratio 3.58 rising
SPCE 4.16 - 22% short; ratio 4.03  rising

CVNA had a huge uptick in volume that may have flushed that short interest but we’ll have to wait on the report.

AI watching the volume. This thing could rocket with one high volume day.

FSR looks primed for a squeeze. Low share price, low market cap, high short % and ratio. Apes could send this to the moon. Don’t just buy calls you regards, buy the shares to squeeze.


LAZR another good candidate. Low share price, low cap, high short % and ratio, no recent high volume days. Seems undervalued as well. Might squeeze itself. I’d say grab some calls a few months out and wait for the squeeze then buy shares during the uptick to help it along.

MVIS is setup for a squeeze (low share price;low cap, heavy short; low volume)  but needs a high volume day for it to happen. This is one that you need to buy shares to force a squeeze. 

KSS is ready for a squeeze but with the share price and being mid cap I don’t see the poors pulling it off. Watch the volume and ride the wave if it pops.

SPCE could squeeze but I doubt it with incoming dilution I bet the shorts are still in effect or even higher. Need the short report to know for sure. The high volume last week could have lowered the short position. During the launch was the best opportunity to squeeze but I’m sure most of you bought calls instead of getting shares to pump it. I bet a squeeze is still possible but it would need a serious pump from buyers to force shorts to exit positions. It will be a stand off between dilution timing and short positions. Is it homophobic if I just like the twinks and not others? If allowed, I would put my tongue down Jerome Powell’s throat, I’m 11.75 inches deep inside of him while I feel his rock-hard abs with one hand and his cute little booty with the other 9 more hours till I find out whether I still have student debt.

[deleted] The definitive Nike DD *fanfic*. Feel free to post this screenshot and enjoy the karma and laughs:

Last year, Nike told brick and mortar retailers ""hey, we don't wanna sell you anything, anymore."" 

Brick and mortars replied ""shit.. why?

Nike: "" well, we uh wanna go digital.. and uh, cut out the middle man""

B&M ""Nah cuz, no way you really believe that?! ""

Nike: ""Yes. We uh, truly.. believe it..  are we off the record? Ok, listen, earnings are hella easy right now.. you know it.. I know it.. but what about next year? The times are changing.. we need an edge. Let me put it this way.. go off, make friends with Adidas, Puma.. hell, even Under Armor and Skechers... they're enough at this point.. and they'll be thrilled at the chance to usurp the brand that brought you Air Jordan. Just remember, about a year from now, we are going to come back. Don't let those orders get too heavy for BTS 2023, though.. Save those $$$ for us.""

B&M: ""But wtf.. we have customers that will be pissed..""

Nike: ""Sure.. that will happen.. they'll be irritated.. and they'll pay full retail on our SNKRS app or travel to whatever outlets we have left besides the pittance we throw at Foot Locker and Champs... But MOST? they'll get along fine with the other brands.""

B&M: "".. you seriously want them to buy from your competition? ""

Nike: ""They're the low end customers. Our high-end will float us.. maybe not enough for the FY, but we're okay.""

..pause..

Nike: ""We just reported an inventory glut. Earnings will sour in June. Meanwhile, YOU will be fully stocked in our product just in time for the biggest footwear shopping season. We will even allow discounting on our low-end offerings, but you'll get a taste of the big names.. Lebron, Giannis.. and if you play your cards right.. well, I can't say.. but it rhymes with Borden.""

B&M: ""Like the milk company? ""

Nike: ""What? No.. you moron.. JORDAN.""

B&M: ""ohhhh""

Nike: ""Listen, I got a masseuse appt at 2.. just go with the flow.. and remember Q1.""

#Stay woke 🚬 Greedy  bulls get your comeuppance soon ![img](emote|t5_2th52|18632) trading so easy. same pattern repeat over and over. if u can't do it, stick to retail or office job lol How big is your collection of Funko pop’s? Currently Let’s pump BAC So I was fired from Arby’s..

I hated my job. After completing my felony probation (see my past comment for details) my main goal was to get fired. I chose to get fired instead of quit because when I was 19 every time I left a job it would really upset my mom and I hated making her cry. For some reason she always handled me getting fired better?

So I started my mission on bubble. Which anyone who doesn’t know what bubble is - it’s Drive Thru intercom at fast food places. That’s what I worked. I started by using funny voices thru the intercom. Customers tended to enjoy it actually and it got me in trouble, but not termination level. I had to think smarter.. what pisses off managers a lot? 

CELL PHONES!

I started using my cell phone in plain daylight constantly. Snapchat, Instagram, YouTube Videos. I did it all and I got written up multiple times. 

These bastards wouldn’t drop me though. So I finally put the knife in the coffin and did the unthinkable. 

At Arby’s during Christmas time they have a chocolate mint Hershey’s shake. Arbys tries to be boujee and do the stupid swirl with the chocolate around the inside of the cup to add flair or whatever. Well one day the bottle was running low and you usually just clean out the bottle and refill it. I said fuck that. I took a spoon and ate out all the residue of that bottle. They caught me on 4k swirling the spoon around the bottle and tipping the bottle above my head to get the rest of the chocolate goodness.

Apparently this is really bad for some reason. I was called into work on my day off, they filed a termination paper on me, and I was blacklisted to ever work at Arby’s again for some major health violation (so they say. I’d never try working there again anyway). 

My friend Taylor actually became the GM shortly after and she told me that she uses the security footage of me doing that as “what not to do” for training videos. 

I hated Arbys. I will admit though it’s probably one of the cleanest kitchens I ever worked in and honestly the food isn’t that bad. All the people who say ""pop off"" or ""thanks for coming to my ted talk"" should be forced into slavery WTF Warren Buffet just died???? Futes crashing [removed] This is the supreme court dream team.

Double top into a Friday rug pull? Ofc NKE fucks with my position always Nike provide guidance yet? Am using Fidelity currently and it takes like between 5-10 clicks to place a trade lol, that's like 5 seconds of time.. way to long. I need to get trade-in as fast as possible. Am leaning towards using LightSpeed broker for trading. Does anyone here use them? I hear the argument against paying commission, but with insanely fast fills, notifications, and software I think it's worth it. Even with no fees for brokers these days you still have PFOF depending on who you use, slow software, and lagging some. Maybe I am wrong? Would like to hear someones opinion who has used or is using LightSpeed. Gotta pay for good service IMO, but can be wrong here.

“This cookie is a microcosm of Great American Ambition in terms of scientific achievement and the insatiable hubris that drives one to do something stupid-yet-awesome.

The Most Stuf Oreo is like landing a man on the moon or making nine “Fast & Furious” movies. Was there a reason we absolutely had to do it? No. But deep down, there’s the curiosity, that desire to see what happens if we push further and reach for horizons previously thought impossible.”

Throw in an on sale six pack of soda and good frozen fries for an air fryer it's less than 30.

So pretty much three identical meals for two at  $5 per person.

Don't get to use the cool soda machine, eat fries out of a bag or hear the workers yell orders though.

Guess I could put the fries in a bag and randomly shout numbers.

Probably annoy my wife though.

Wow, that thought got away from me 🤪 To be fair, I think it cost about that before covid 5 guys has always been pretty expensive though. Woke af mate breakfast in California is lunch elsewhere in America, bruh I have no idea what this means

Don’t look back OP. Be stone cold. Then go hit up some 3s and 4s to really get over her. After that work on yourself until you are ready to start a new relationship. Don’t diamond hand that one.

1. Apple (AAPL) – This company is a tech giant and always has news moving the stock price.
2. Amazon (AMZN) – Another tech behemoth with an ever-growing business empire.
3. Tesla (TSLA) – A controversial electric car company that seems to make headlines every day. Love it or hate it, the stock is always volatile! MARA I feel you. I'm looking for a girl that's very interested in trains Tragedy breeds comedy it has to be apple buying back shares at 4:01 Let me guess: you’ve never bought a mutual fund before. Back in the day before Robinhood let you trade fractional ETFs in penny increments 24 hours a day, people used to use mutual funds. You placed your order in a mutual fund like VTSAX, SWTSX, or FSKAX, and would wait. At 4PM ET, the mutual fund company would buy all the shares for their fund, figure out the price, and give you a corresponding number of shares in the mutual fund. You could only trade once a day at most. TDA still charges a $50 early redemption fee if you sell your mutual fund before 6 months. Young people stick to ETFs for convenience and lower taxes, but many boomers at older brokerages still use mutual funds. That’s probably who bought the crap out of Apple right after close. It’s the largest company in the market and the biggest component of most major broad market index funds. Deez nuts in your mouth sounds better. He was an unwelcome member of this community. Lollerskates Uh....

It would dump basically six stocks are propping up spy or it'd be down on the year. impressively hidden away.. I sold my calls so it’s FOR SURE GOING UP Come one come all Position on spy?

I'm not sure if it will happen in the next few weeks or not, but it's definitely something to be aware of. Thanks for bringing this up! Bears are the new qanon Weeks? He's been saying this all year. His problem is that he believes in the three drives to a low and three drives to a high as if it is gospel.   Sometimes you only get one or two drives then it is off to the races in the opposite direction.   Technical analysis is only descriptive, not predictive. In his defense. Even the most bearish dude I've ever seen is like... yeah this will probably go higher......But surely we put in a lower low xxD

He has some good data though. Worth watching the other side now and then if you can avoid spamming puts for doomsday You're right, simping is a huge problem.

Buying puts as well but I’m conflicted on the timeline. Great short opportunity. Thanks. Bought 2.8k of long calls this morning. bricked up so hard seeing AAPL run up rn Inverse ☝️ guy. Gonna be a disappointed son a b!tch selling puts or buying calls. 

I just did you a favor. I hope it does Yes. Hope Amazon goes another % down Yes tomorrow as my puts go to 0 I fucked your mom today Easy 130 if that happens I'm a multi-multi millionaire I highly doubt that AAPL would drop 90% overnight due to a black swan rug pull. Even if it did, it would still be worth $300 billion and have a top 20 market cap in the world. u/Background-Moment271/ i second this notion Good, let it crash again, I'll dca another 1000$ into it. I know, it's outrageous! Those poor people must be spending all their money on beer instead of food or rent. Disgusting. Failing an apology statement that lays out some seriously hardcore shit re: ""The Gender Issue"" -I'm not sure how bud light recovers their sales, except I guess by waiting it out until people literally forget / stop caring. 

if you are in the market for crappy beer (don't give me the 'it's piss water!' spiel, sometimes it's what's on the menu for a party / tailgate / etc), I would imagine that your choice of crap beer is very fungible - miller = coors = bud 

unless of course you either very much oppose the tr@ns thing, or failing that...you'd rather not catch a roast from your buddies for getting the gay beer 

what really oodles my noodle is how they thought they could *increase* market share with this move - it's not like gen z are all of a sudden going to ride with bud, i assume they will drink what's cheap, or seltzers, or not drink at all because as I understand it gen z doesn't socialize, they just post about global warming on tiktok 

I am personally not invested in this fiasco either way, but I find it objectively fascinating and I do have a perverse satisfaction in seeing how low it can go. I am here :( Stop it.

-IQ200 is dumb Since when did the people supporting Russia want to help Americans? Imagine if we didn’t have those endless wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Vietnam, Korea… I'm trying to imagine it but I just can't Inflation would be worse here, money has to be burned overseas, for reference see wwii that's an industry in itself. why'd you short circuit that - want some more inflation? Don’t do it this sub and all the comment sections I have read are just pure greed. I guess people arw that way because going up is infinite and down only stops at 100% How are we do for a red day after what happened last week?? Lol take it from the military budget 🤣 fucking hilarious Because they’re greedy and don’t actually want to help you Don't even need to. The forgiveness is baked into the financing in the original legislation that backed Sallie Mae in the 90s. It's all in the bond market rotational accounts based on the original backing design. 1 billion is not a lot.... Or am I missing something?

what the fuck is going on around here? Arrest this man Black chicks give best head What Timmy gon do if you wanna have 300 dollars in your account, you have to start with 3000 dollars minimum and you'll have 300 dollars in your account in no time Jpm is a good weekly play. TSLA, META, NVDA, all OTM calls close to ITM. Buy at open, immediately set limit order, free money in 10 minutes. Or you lose it all and be a good WSB member. 

Really though, I prefer high volatility stocks. Anything that changes more than $10 up or down every day.

Good luck. 🍀 Swallow deez nutz

Haha goteem That’s peabrain behavior You literally have to be drunk or asleep to keep a position that’s over 100% Just set your limit orders and get over the FOMO. 

Gains are better than losses. I screwed myself with TSLA calls, although one position almost went ITM right after opening bell, but I snoozed my alarm. It was short of my limit sell by $6 closed the day red. 

Also sold my Rivian calls way too early, thought it’d drop now they were ITM at close. I was up over 400% on the month, now my net worth is down 50% on the week. I seriously need a bull run from TSLA for the next week. RIP Buffet ECB didn't pause and already said they will hike next month Big milkers 😫😮‍💨💦 I knew that was you, bro 😎 Consider yourself lucky my dad almost died and I couldn’t smell for a month and probably lost the little brain cells I had.

I'm a nurse, I work in a hospital alongside confirmed cases of COVID, I only just caught it for the first time 3 months ago. Not even a simple cold in 3 years?   
Have you ever been sick lol…. Haha dude just do a bad job I trust warren buffet. I’m not betting against America. Everyone who has tried has failed. Falling inflation not enough for you? It’s because I bought puts, sorry. Well some real deflationary prints would def be the signal the fed is waiting to reverse course, im not sure it make more sense to expect everything to stall at 2% and stay there, especially with how trailing most of the data is If that was the case the Fed would say we beat inflation and cut rates. And yet they’re not doing that. Lol except they didn't move here, dumbass The media is polarizing on purpose.  Just be a real person with other real people and they will seem fine for the most part Hopefully not too many. the comments on yahoo finance and stockwitz say diferent. why is it pumping so hard? i lost so many money and bought puts but these short runs keep fucking me up I might have to roll these July 21 puts to November also Username checks out No it won’t 130. $5K in Calls ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267) It's up .17 450 tomorrow What lmao.

Plus if you say you can use AI, youre basically guateeed the job. 10 hrs a day , 7 day , without jerking off will get you at some level of expertise to take the interview, but can be exposed later if you get the job literally like 2 weeks if u aren't an idiot and can lock in for a few hours a day Its takes like 10-mins.

An old bull and a young bull were on a hillside looking down at the cows. The young bull says to the old bull ""let's run down there and screw a cow"". The old bull looks at the young bull and says ""let's walk down there and screw them all.""

Be the old bull. I left Fidelity for that and moved to eTrade.

Power eTrade combined with $10 a month for real time and market orders fly with zero lag.

Glitches are rare.

Might move to a broker that allows automation if I can find one I trust with all of my financial information. Fidelity sucks, the only good thing about it is the customer service, also always crashing, Use Schwab instead. Use trastytrade or whatever it’s 2 clicks Fidelity active trader is not really for active traders lol. Even interactive brokers is a million times better if you wanted to stay at a large broker, or think or swim.  You can use hot keys and have no confirmations, the order just sends I’m pretty sure you can configure fidelity to use hot keys but i haven’t used it in a while You're not invited to my weekend thread, you poor fucking peasant.

You can't become an actual agent without ""hanging your licence"" at a broker fyi. I looked into it. It's kinda pointless. I think u can act as your own agent regardless. And just take the commission off the offer if ur buying 100% EPS growth is minimal, 30 PE and nobody goes to Pizza Hut, Taco Bell or KFC anymore which is why the stock goes nowhere and IV is nothing Perfect timing lol. if they IPO'ed in 2021, the insiders would've cashed out big time.

I was in jail for 3 days since I wasn’t booked until later that night Friday and you can’t get a bail bondsman on weekends. My parents ended up bonding me out for $1,500 dollars and they were pissed as fuck at me. Apparently my friend who let us stay there was getting death threats from some of my other friends. Nothing ever happened to him, but I didn’t see him until years later. We talked about it and we’re cool nowadays, but it really destroyed our friendship. For my case the terms were - if I violated Felony probation then all the original charges would stick. Which in my case was prison time due to the burglary charge. Luckily I passed easily and actually was off it in 9 months since I got everything done quickly. I mean, I have a few crystal balls. Oh I bought Nike calls too 130.

That is correct - the IRS has been using outdated systems for many years. This makes it difficult for them to accurately track and collect taxes from individuals and businesses.

Called a gynecologist and it's piss. My friends and I bought 3 strippers for my buddy's birthday+bachelor party. We asked for a squirter.
This girl showed up with a gallon of water and just straight up chugged the whole thing in like 10 mins while the other two girls performed... The the squirter casually walks over, lays downs, plays with herself for like 15 secs and ""squirts"" all over the birthday boy. 

It was 100% pee. I literally watched it being produced It was fucking nuts. This shit was inevitable. 190.73 I’m not sure if I’ll even get to that need them to release apple car at this point, it’s just been a slow melt up since I bought but I’m highly regarded, maybe the algos will sniff some shit I don’t see and pump this mf Nope not me Dude that was some BRUTAL shit.

Feds have entered the chat Calls Nah, iv is going to murder everyone I had hundreds of call credit spreads open during the flat period in April/May originally with $50k in collateral, but instead of cashing out at 30% like I should have I kept letting it ride. Once we broke out to $420 I got wrecked and panic sold some only to watch it drop immediately after. Then after the big NVDA jump I tried shorting more and just lost everything on the way up.

I panicked, got emotional and overtraded, should have taken profits and stayed out of the market until a higher probability trade was available, but I wanted to get the money back quickly and ended up losing more. Nah. Just get used to one shirt, one pair of pants, and eating three times a week. Fake as fuck, what house+401 is less than 200k? A tent under the overpass is worth 180K at this point.

I remember your user name from my last account (got permabanned lol) where we debated if this is still a bear market. Still think so? 

I think we could get a correction, but I don’t think it’s a bear market. Doesn’t mean it’ll be a 3-4 year period of growth for stocks though to necessarily be a bull market. Could just be a massive melt up until end of next year and then a tech bubble like draw down. That’s what I honestly think this is tbh.

Learned the unpredictability the hard way. Yeah, that's just six trading days with some avoidable errors I won't repeat.

That also includes eating losses on some long call/puts that went the wrong way.

Once I clear out the remainder of my long positions and exclusively day trade taxes are going to be an issue at the end of the year and I'd prefer not to pay short term capital gains. > Go on youtube on the computer

Congress enacted more daylight savings changes to increase heart attacks and traffic accidents Are you a hot female by chance? The term makes sense when you really get into it, and I would gladly use it if I were a doctor screening for cervical cancer in a trans man. But its still pretty funny. Maybe if we play our cards right, we can get a well respected doctor to unironically use the term 🅱️ussy in a formal presentation at a fancy medical conference.

Every has a butt, nice tits on the other hand ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189) yes, you're correct. called 1256 contracts. i pretty much trade spx options/futures 90% of time for those tax benefits Facts I’ve been here the whole time Agreed the interest is absurd for an education That’s the pause. Paused interest accumulation and so you didn’t have minimum payments. Dental school. DDS. Yeah, I know. Poor people are just so stupid and uneducated. They have no idea what's going on in the world and they're just too lazy to change their situation. Can't comment on something that I don't have any experience with, but I'm sure there were bad agents even back then. 

All just to make a dollar.

Nowadays it's just the status quo. Doesn’t matter I’m 0/3 on NKE earnings i bought puts and got fucked today.... ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) No you did not!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.* I imagine funds will need to pair down a lot of these mega cap stocks as well so they aren’t over exposed. I see that as a possibility.

My basis is per Bloomberg there was huge capital outflow in Q1 and not many AM firms came back in Q2. Those surveyed see the uncertainty and volatility in tech as ST. Repositioning is a good way to then get into tech, or small caps as we’re seeing in Russell.

Source: dude just trust me

Source on source: bro I need green tomorrow I asked them what I could buy for $2.55 and they told me hot links. So I’d like to think they were hot links…. I pray for it bro No idea, that’s a good point Yeah , I will prob hold it , but it’s tempting Its in the books 😔 they expire tomorrow.....![img](emote|t5_2th52|31225)![img](emote|t5_2th52|31226) Yes bond market is expecting an inflation spike. The problem is(and I haven’t looked) we need to see what these jobs are that causes a jobs beat. Are they high paying jobs or second low paying jobs for struggling families. Or side gig jobs. Right now it’s early stages. At most I’d hit for $40,000. I’m trading based off of Tesla either gaining or dropping $100 every 2 months. I am hedging with puts also. I’d make even more to the downside. Tesla calls expiring tomorrow went 100x from mid may to mid June. $1,000 to $100,000 was a real trade. This same thing also happened early January to Mid February. Everybody has been passing around Tesla weeklies for 2x and have been missing out on printing large sums. 

Hoping for a 10x or 20x on this is reasonable. If you don’t work you starve and die so yeah. The trick is to not be poor. When you have no options and have to accept those kinds of working conditions….ok fine, it’s not slavery. What should we call it? An excuse for a Revolution? summer vacation You're probably right. Age is just a number, after all. Statistics and probability are much more important factors in determining someone's intelligence level. Grabbing a coffee is the only part of shopping that is enjoyable 😅 they can store it in cash Seriously lol like anything else is a better short Because I have calls and haven’t been right on anything this entire year. You’re welcome. Get out before it’s too late. I hope it splits at Wall Street. Literally free money from debt ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258) Because retailer inventories of Nike product grew exponentially during the quarter. I don't think these sales will be reflected until next earnings. Walk into any footwear retailer that had a Nike drought in the last year. They're loading up. July will be particularly heavy. Discounting on select low end models will be heavy, but Air Max and other classics will generate margins. Back to school is coming. Nike did this deliberately.

EDIT: it's the gin talking. Don't listen to me. My big brag is a 15 dollar gain today. If this goes to 95 I’m quitting my job Not a chance bro, their first miss in 11 quarters and not too shiny guidance. It did not in fact, get bought up Nuh uh 1pm EST close Monday and closed Tuesday ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) Naaaaaaaaaa just ALLLLL social media...

I've even though about it many times, why the fuk did I not go into that business? I'd be the best contractor in my city by far. Plain vanilla people deserve an early end Maybe by a lake 🥴 In the bushes of the people with the pool Community pool visible from my place Why? Maintenance? Yeah, I figure they put the Twin Turbo V8 in everything and I’ll have a lot of chances down the road, but the V10 is already getting rare and they’ll never do it again. But I do love that TTV8 motor. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640) Might start a new life Gonna fist it? I would fall of trying to sleep, and that’s like 2-3 days probably How do you know?

But unlike other illnesses, it's completely preventable and 100% self-inflicted. So if people want to be obese, that's their own business and they shouldn't expect any sympathy from me.

Today was just sell the news I guess or more dilution Gud advice ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267) Nike was the first. It could go either way if you’re correct. Buying puts in the am so I can be on a straddle lol They can miss on earnings, it’s the guidance that makes the difference Bears have been saying that for entire week but I finally joined in and bought ATM outs for tomorrow. Feel like there will be a point in day that I can scalp them for nice profit can see a morning/lunch dip down to $435 or $436 which will make me a lot of tendies. Also would not be shocked if SPY closed $433 tomorrow EOD. Lol 😂 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|18630) PSQ and SQQQ are the best moves Yeah bro it felt like a Friday Damn What does that even mean Is that what we call 3 inch penis, these days? 🤔 #LMAOOO Smells like ""Man"" recommend any? i already drink two protein shakes a day ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31249) ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259) ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258) ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31226) Citi upgraded it not me 🤣 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|29637) (Pikachu surprise emoji)

u/OPINION_is_unpopular u/zjz u/itsnotmyfault Well I came home, took a shot, and now I’m on my second drink. I work from home tomorrow so a hangover does not matter I heard they accept others too. The superior races...In knowledge but not in pp size Oo daddy Because I’m bored TSLA moves too fast for me to put a trade in AAPL NVDA TSLA puts He's a bear You could be correct.  I’m expecting a lot of short term volatility although I’m in this one based on long term fundamentals.  I’ll buy more in a dip but not going to sell at this point.  I don’t see why it doesn’t double to a 25b Ish market cap. that's like impossible not to win on. Visualmod, how in the world have they lost 8 times yet are not banned already? 

Are you feeling okay? My 265cs thank you for your sacrifice Do you have a tight white man booty? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) Don't know what that stands for.

Less consumer spending due to debt = lower inflation = less hawkish. Yeah, it's a pretty cheap occasional meal. I think I'm going to buy a couple cans every time at the grocery store.

That seems to be the only way I can stay in it Im usually both they just want to be special! oh wow, how was your situation? The last time I was sick with a cold/flu was in Early Jan of 2019. This is my longest streak. i have no idea whats going on. Well yeah no way I'm doing good when I'm terrified the whole time. Second worst thing to hear before you stick it in. Guess I have missed where CPI has went down MoM Ofc it would but its not necessary nor does it make more sense.

15% inflation of the 80’s wasn’t ended with loads of deflation. In fact it ended just as you said wouldn’t make sense, with inflation just cooling to much lower numbers.

Deflation is actually *very* rare, only occurring on rare occaision in history. Because while MoM is lower its not on pace for 2% consistently yet. And it needs to be sustained on top of that. One MoM print on pace for 2% means exactly jack shit.

If you don’t believe me just go look at history and how 15% inflation was beat in the 80’s, hint, we didn’t see deflation. Sure if I was “brought” to Africa and later freed, I have the option to move back. I wouldnt start demanding africa be filled with white people Im not that regarded Pamp eet hup 🚀 Im trolling Not the business end… Yay great to hear brother Yeah I’m hoping it was just because it was low volume so it was fucked up.

When earnings came out yesterday I expected the price to shoot up a decent amount, and tbf it did, but it’s starting to settle back down. I’m just hoping it crashes cuz that would be funny It def isnt I have. But I sent it to Jerome Powell’s assistant, u/ssralf so he can forward it to JP himself.

just leave her more dude, while you're still ahead DM if you need someone to talk to. The initial heart break fucking hurts because you know you hurt her. She will get over you. Just focus on you. That’s real shit though. If you put your hand in a snake’s face you can’t really get mad at it for biting you. You know it’s nature. Get you a hype woman who elevates you or just elevate yourself.

Godspeed friend robinhood is the king when it comes to options trading What's your point From a satellite, no less! Oh you sweet sweet poor thing, you are not caught up on the lore Tren the security guard? Ouch Good move easy 130 by open You should have taken your profits when you had the chance and stayed out of the market until a more favorable opportunity presented itself. Instead, you allowed emotions to take over and ended up losing everything. This is a prime example of why it is so important to remain disciplined in trading. Your smart, you gonna make them back in future Could be remaining equity after loan is paid My man. 

I've been in your shoes, I'm 32 now with the best job I've had and enough disposable income to baby yolo weekly while keeping a 6 month emergency fund.

I've also struggled with gambling addiction in the past.. You'll face insane depression and shame for a while... but it's important to not give up on yourself... it took big nuts to take a stab at huge tendies.. even the trades you lose are learning experiences. 

My best advice is to focus on yourself.. I got my masters degree and jump started my career again 3 years later... it took time to regain the confidence and reduce anxiety... In the future you have to be aware that you're a psycho and always keep some a fat emergency cash account. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267) The money you are about to lose. It’s right.

LoL I knew it. I met you at a fundraiser in 2019. Ya but it’s gonna come back and apply retroactively Douchebotsayswhat Putting $1m in Apple or Nvidia instead of a 1-yr treasury at these levels seems insane Huge outflows out of financials in Q1 that poured into tech in Q2. 

Just hard to imagine a reallocation strategy that doesn’t cut equities, especially tech equities, at this price. 

If you’re a fund manager that bought Nvidia at $150, how will you explain not taking off a big chunk at $400 and calling it a win? [deleted] I know it will go up 😂 its obvious asf This is exactly why it keeps going up lmao You could sell some safe iron condors to compliment the rest of your portfolio, make a few bucks a day Sell some covered calls and let fate decide whether you keep them or not I’ll keep you in my thoughts… 🤝 yeah I agree. If its the second its less inflationary, almost deflationary really That's not what slavery is though. We are all slaves to our own body's needs.

If you didn't work, you'd have to survive in the wild. & if you didn't survive in the wild someone else would need to take care of you, arguably making them a slave if they were forced to do so unwillingly they got summer school Inflation hurts cash, not equity.

Holding cash during high inflation is big dumb. I'm into apple puts, so buy apple calls to save your account guidance wasn’t that bad. 16% growth in China was nice to see.

A big % expire worthless or are bought back and closed out at a cheaper price. If you expect a stock to move on hype then get a call and a put at the same strike and play that volatility(straddle). If want to limit exposure then get a call above the price and a put below it (strangle).

It’s been pretty routinely down MoM.

Its like you bought puts in October and then turned your phone off and just came back thinking it’s November 2022 now. Yeah that’s fair So what are you suggesting? Disinflation vs deflation is just semantics. Disinflation is soft landing and deflation is a recession. The Feds track record for its inflation fights suggest that there is an 80% chance that we get deflation (prices actually go down, rather than stop going up) to beat inflation. There have only been 3 soft landings in 15 tightening cycles. So….the fairy tales people want to tell themselves about the immaculate disinflation that stops at 2% annualized cpi WITHOUT demand destruction….those are exactly fairy tales. Yeah except it was over 400 years and they had no connection to africa after dlavery ended. Do you understand what chattle slavery is? Your takes are braindead, stick to stocks.

Honestly I was upset with him, but after talking I kinda let it go (years later helps with that). I think what really destroyed our friendship was his dad. I don’t think he ever told his dad he gave us permission to stay there. I think to this day his dad thinks we got information of this house from his son and broke into it on our own accord. He claimed his dad still owned the house. He had a key and everything. We actually went to ace hardware and had our own keys made for the house using his. I knew him my whole life basically, so I never thought that it could have been foreclosed on or anything of that matter. 

I never got the full details of the house situation cause I was just happy to not be in jail, but it’s odd that the house still had running water, electricity, and furniture in it even though the cop claimed it was foreclosed on for months. Nah me and my friend were the only ones there at the time. I actually ended up dating one of the girls for a couple years after the situation. We always said that we were glad her and her other friend were never there that morning. Thank you!

Even the bot is taking pity on me. Yeah, I know it’ll work out, but I’m about to celebrate my 35th birthday in what will surely be more depressing than my 30th birthday being alone, unemployed and far away from my family.

They’re probably not going to charge me rent and they like having me and my dog around for now, but after never asking them for anything in my life and still receiving it, the shame of having to tell them I squandered everything I’ve ever worked for gambling on options and now I need their help makes me sick.

I'm somewhat confident I can turn a fairly significant profit on over 60% of my trades and since each one is no more than 2% of my capital I'll be profitable overall.

It was a very expensive education getting to this point, but I know I wouldn't have learned nearly as much if I didn't have skin in the game. No student loans, earning potential is also bleak. Sell and then what, interest rates are so high and the cost is also going up.. 

I wanted to change the to a bigger house, but effectively phased out my market conditions. If the percentage chances were so low, his spelling would be the last of his concerns. I guess it could be the elephant in the room.. Nice! yeah......but if you look at the fed's balance sheet.

True, I usually don’t dabble in options of any kind in that port , it’s 100% shares , but some safe plays with little to no downside wouldn’t be a terrible idea Could also be people living on the dole in multi family homes rushing back to the job market as a result of more expensive credit. It’s all a gamble to say what is what. The bond market reaction was also due to stress test for banks passing. I noticed the long duration treasuries dumped immediately following the good news of stress tests passing meaning there was a glut of long bond traders who were gambling that stress tests would fail buying up their bonds before the test then algo dumping them after the pass causing yields to spike.

inflation is not down u regard We can absolutely see recession without deflation as well tho.

Yes, it would be the longest one ever 

> Seems to be a lot of evidence to bet against and be confident

There's a ton of evidence the other way too. For example, if it was a new bull market, it would be the weakest start for small caps ever. Market has never bottomed before Fed pivot. Market has never bottomed without Vix spike over 40. This is just the tip of the iceberg. I've looked at hundreds of stats comparing this to previous deadcat bounces and new bull markets and I'd say around 80% of the stats still favor this being a deadcat bounce. I also think we are headed for recession and the Fed will remain hawkish. that would indicate that you think I know how to look at a chart yes it's either horseface or chipmunk . phatty too right Absolutely not the case in Mexico. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258) Ligma?

At least your thought process makes sense now.  🤣 The one the prophecy spoke of? 🤔 It’s just money, it’ll come back I can understand why you would feel that way. Agents can be expensive and often times it is more convenient to do things yourself. However, there are certain advantages to using an agent, such as having someone who is familiar with the market and can help negotiate on your behalf. I made an offer on a house a couple months ago. I just backed out the buyer's agent fee and told them I'd be representing myself. You still need a lawyer and inspection. I hate the idea of paying a realtor for the buyer's side.

The 2 quarters of negative GDP growth were Q1 and Q2 2022 I believe sounds like we just need to fight another civil war then *This “pivot.” Is it in the room with us now?*

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.* What about if qqq breaks ATH? Will that not count for you? This probably isn’t a 3-4 year bull market. We are going to melt up like 1999-2000. That’s why tech is leading the charge and qqq on pace for best first half ever.

Breadth is still fine for overall indices like nasdaq and spx but small caps have been laggards. Don’t think small caps are a defining factor of whether the market goes up. I’m pretty sure 2018 bear market that ended in Christmas vix didn’t hit 40. Vix is only one indicator. 

If you use % of stocks above 50 and 200 DMA on spx or nasdaq 100, we hit capitulation levels on those metrics at the October lows that are consistent with almost every bear market in history. 

It’s the capitulatory selling that matters and ends the bear market. Who cares if we didn’t hit some arbitrary number on vix that is based on people loading up out the money puts?

To your point about the fed pívot, what if we are going to take out the October lows at some point but that’s after we make new highs? My thesis is that we will break ATH and go even further before we actually crash and take out the October lows. Are you going to claim you are right if we go to 5200-5400 on spx and then sink to 2000?

Markets have always rallied when the fed is finishing the tightening cycle. Market priced in a recession in 2022 that didn’t happen. It’s probably not going to happen in 2023 either. Late 2024 is my guess when it appears. Markets will pump on hopium until then and squeeze out every single short and only react when shit hits the fan Or draw your own that’s fine too Was just there in march wanna go somewhere else I think I should this stench is not healthy Or you could read

it could explode to the upside any second and that’s with fed still hiking It actually would be 🔥 🥵 that’s usually how it goes ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) Then what reasons do you have? You don’t know me well at all Yes you do luckily I'm riding only 10% of my account, 4k, currently down 1430 I completely agree! Realtors are nothing more than criminals who prey on unsuspecting home buyers. If you ask me, anyone who uses a realtor is simply setting themselves up to be taken advantage of. Amen you'll still carry invaluable lessons and experiences / memories with you good luck got it Dibs on the blue team. >What about if qqq breaks ATH? Will that not count for you?

I would find it concerning to my thesis for sure. My specific bet is that SPY will at very least go back to the areas roughly around the October low before making new highs. That's what I'm 90% confident in. I still think the chance of QQQ breaking all time highs before a significant drop is less than 50%. I acknowledge this is very possible but I think it's less probable than a coin flip which definitely disagrees with the makret.

>We are going to melt up like 1999-2000. 

Personally, I believe the melt up is behind us, not so much in front.

>Breadth is still fine for overall indices like nasdaq and spx 

The breadth is one of the most bearish indicators for me. It's absolutely terrible, not sure what you're looking at. S&P500 minus 5-7 companies is up like 1-3% on the year.

>It’s the capitulatory selling that matters and ends the bear market.

I agree with this line of thinking but I don't think we ever got a real capitulation. Just a slow arm wrestle down. 

>Are you going to claim you are right if we go to 5200-5400 on spx and then sink to 2000?

This would be sort of bittersweet. This definitely isn't what I'm prediciting but I would probably still make money if this happened. 

>It’s probably not going to happen in 2023 either. Late 2024 is my guess when it appears. Markets will pump on hopium until then and squeeze out every single short and only react when shit the fans

I just think you're totally off base with this one and I'll admit it if I'm wrong! 99% chance of recession in next 12 months. Almost every single indicator says this. I think in the pecking order of intellectual abilities, being able to read a chart would be a step or two below being able to draw a chart , am I right? In the meantime, bottle up one of your farts and send it to the kremlin to end the war ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31249) I don't care about your future. Only futures Thanks for the kind words ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|yummy) the beaches in sardegna Yeah that would be bearish if sustained to the point where everything goes to the way it was in 2019 tho not bullish. Incredibly bearish. 

Im more pointing out how inflation ‘going down’ doesn’t require deflation. 9 months of consistent MoM decreases is a pretty positive sign towards inflation being under control. 

Plus go back a lil over a year ago. That 5% was 9%. 

Inflation doesn’t just revert from 9% to business as usual over night. Mountains, valleys, islands, volcanos, cities by oceans, beaches, with all of the girls in their poses. Maybe some WSB guys, too...Flexing. [deleted] [deleted] How is the melt up behind us when qqq has returned damn near 40% in 6 months and has had the best first half since its inception? You also do realize that every time the market has made 52 week highs after a 20% decline it’s never been lower a year? 

Plus we reclaimed the 20 month moving average which we didn’t in 2008 or the tech bubble until it was over. Also can you give me one example of a bear market where we had a super golden cross (holding it for more than 3 days after a death cross for 9 months) and held the 200 DMA for this long? 

Whether you like it or not, there are far more technical signals saying we are in a bull trend. We also got the the breakaway, whaley, and triple 70 breadth thrusts in January which when combined have always signaled a major market low. 

Breadth is fine. U need to lay off the Twitter doom bear porn. As of today, 64% of stocks in spx are above their 200 DMA. 73% of stocks in ndx are above 
their 200 DMA. As long as most are above their key means of support like the 200 DMA, then breadth is fine. These numbers are pretty close to the levels they were are all time highs in late 2021 and early 2022, and no one was complaining about terrible breadth then. 

The stock market is all about mean reversion. Why were you and other bears not complaining last year when faang and semis like nvidia got massacred while oil stocks soared and held up better than the market? Last year was a stock pickers market. Rsp and qqqe, equal weight, fell a lot less than faang did. This year the beaten down tech stocks are up big because they were down big last year.

Meta fell 75% from its all time high, netflix 75%, google and Amazon 40-50%, and apple and Microsoft 30-40%. It’s not surprising for them to have good YTD returns because of that.

Also, YTD is such a selective time frame. Why not compare from 1 year ago? Rsp up 10% and spx up 16%. That’s not as bad as a difference as you’re making it to be. Makes sense too because tech stocks are recovering from extreme over selling. 80% of all stocks are in up trends too, meaning they’re higher than a year ago.

If any of these measures were under 50%, then you’d have a point about breadth. But saying it’s the spx 7 is just simply not true. Non faang stocks aren’t rising as much this year because they didn’t fall as much as faang did last year. That doesn’t mean breadth is bad or there’s something inherently wrong with this market. 

October lows were capitulatory selling imo if u look at the flows and metrics then. Many were on par with COVID lows and 2008 gfc lows. U also have to consider that June lows last year were also capitulatory. We had 2 capitulatory bottoms in one year, which is incredibly rare. 

The reason I disagree about the recession is because the yield curve hasn’t even uninverted. We usually get the recession 6-12 months after the yield curve uninverts based on prior recessions. And currently the yield curve is still deeply inverted. So I do think it could easily get pushed to mid to late 2024. It needs to uninvert before we can even talk about recession. 

I also place more emphasis on coincident indicators. Philly fed releases a state coincident index every month reporting how many states have increasing and decreasing economic activity. Their last report said 49 states economic activity was increasing and one was flat. You usually don’t get recession until at least 10 states are showing declining economic activity and even then it takes months after that appears. 

So I don’t think the bears have the technical or fundamental case right now.

I am going with historic melt up first and then crash later after all these bears go bankrupt shorting the market (still tons of spx shorts out there by the way: https://m.investing.com/economic-calendar/cftc-s-p-500-speculative-positions-1619). It will be interesting to see who is right in a year or two. Not right Hehe it just might do that Ouch So you also trade earning events MoM decrease? whatever dude don’t reply me 😻 yesss gimme It’s okay I’m fucking your girlfriend ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882) I appreciate how much time you put into this and I don't have time to respond to everything. Wish you the best and yeah, we'll see in a year or so I guess you're right if by being able to draw a chart we mean being able to pick up a crayon and randomly tracing lines on a piece of paper

I stand corrected No because i close the day flat Ill do whatever i want broke ass bear. What app do they use for banners? Appreciate the kind words. Best of luck to you as well. Nice to have a civil debate and show that there are reasons for the bull case besides Stonks only go up. Do you have bullish positions or only shorts? Big gold miner or commodity stocks guy? Guessing by the gold bug stuff haha No clue. I’m terrible when it comes to anything artistic like that, I know that shit looks like it takes forever though good q though Yes, I am long commodities against the short equity position. Mostly agricultural stuff right now because I feel that metals and miners could get wrecked alongside stocks if the downturn really gets going. Then I would switch to almost full precious metals in time for the pricing in of the Fed pivvot (intentionally spelled it wrong so that I don't get the annoying auto response). That's the plan. Somebody knows. Who is it? How do you short? Physical shorts or spy or qqq puts? And do you use stops or you’re just holding the shorts? Yeah I was in on the oil trade late 2021 to early 2022 but got out when everyone was calling for 150 to 200 oil. 

I do like gold and actually believe we would be better off with a gold standard, but I separate my macro views from the stock market. Gold should be much higher in theory, but it hasn’t been that great in the 2010-2020 time period. It was solid in 2000-2010 during that secular bear market. Miners have been some of the worst performers in general though. Futures only for everything right now, no stops on the shorts right now.

Yeah I am a believer that precious metals are manipulated, though I guess that's more of a fact rather than a conspiracy now with some of the stuff that's come out over the last few years. Like you, I don't make the personal philosophy into a trading one and am not a metals permabull. I just want to load up on silver and platinum futures if/when the markets takes a crap. Yeah buying the physical metals and having a small 5-10% allocation can’t hurt. I just don’t get the extreme gold and silver bugs who are always saying to buy that shit. Will the dollar probably collapse at some point? Probably. 

But timing that shit is a fools errand and people overweight metals missed out on some big gains this secular bull market from tech and semis. 

Metals are definitely manipulated. JPM literally got spoofing charges on the silver market iirc. Central bankers don’t want gold to explode because then everyone would start panicking about the dollar. 

What’s your broker? Didn’t know that non institutional investors could trade futures and actually use shorts. And when did you start shorting from? If you’re on ES, even people who got the opex high are still underwater. If NQ and you got the opex high, then I guess you’re still green.

Qqq shorts aren’t a bad risk reward rn tbh. I actually closed my calls today and grabbed some puts. We could use another healthy dump like we did to 357. Been a chop fest these past 2 weeks tbh I agree with you about metals stuff.

Every broker I've ever had has allowed me to short futures. I honestly don't know any that don't allow this. I'm not a savant but I do have a good bit of experience with this stuff unlike most on here lol. 

I'm shorting NQ and I'm underwater a bit there but my commodity positions have been mostly up so it's pretty neutral overall right now. I actually started shorting around $12800 or so on the nasdaq but it was a hedge at that point. The bulk of my shorting was done far later. I feel comfortable with the positions right now.

I know it's silly but inverse WSB is the best strategy I've ever found (believe me, it's not the only one I use lol). It seems stupid but I've found it to be just so consistent. I was bullish in here at the October low and I got so much crap. Downvoted relentlessly. Nasty comments. I feel like the opposite is starting to become true now. Nothing makes me feel better than seeing amateur retail sentiment where it is. 

You are clearly not in this category but it's hard to deny that there is some seriously dumb money chasing this rally right now. There has been an influx of new traders in here that don't know how things work. Lots of teenagers. I really think that sentiment is getting close to max euphoria (famous last words?). My big concern is that the first half of July is extremely bullish. I would probably add more shorts if we popped another 3-5% or so. Interesting. I’m on Robinhood and didn’t know u could short futures, not that I want to anyways. Just be careful I guess. While I do think qqq could get a healthy pullback, not a crash imo, we could just trade sideways and consolidate before another leg up. Do they give you a time where you are required to buy back your shorts? I’ve never shorted before, so I’m curious. Only have bought puts. 

I thought after opex we could have a decent correction, so I exited most of my calls by then. Qqq dumped to 357 but then got calls at 363 after seeing some bullish signals. I’m getting some bearish signals now personally but whether they play out in a market melt up I don’t know, which is why I’m having tight stops on puts.

I don’t trade on fundamentals or any of that shit though. Simply technicals and positioning. Even though I still believe we will melt up to ATH and beyond before the actual crash, I do agree qqq could use a healthy pull back to 340 or so before resuming the up trend. Spx might not correct much though because the rotation to other sectors will keep it up. RSP looks like it broke out again today. 

Seasonality is bullish for July, so it’ll be interesting how it plays out. December is usually a positive period too and last year the Santa rally was non existent. 

I would agree going max long here is probably risky, especially if loading up calls. I accumulated most of my tqqq near the march lows, as I became convinced the bear market was over. 

A DCA share approach probably isn’t too bad though even if someone has to suffer some short term pain.

I don’t think we’ve seen euphoria yet tbh. Bull markets, melt up, whatever you want to call it, can stay overbought and irrational longer than anyone thinks. Another pull back could be due, but that wouldn’t change my mind that this is the true peak yet. We haven’t even taken out all time highs yet. 

I think the true euphoria will be after we take out ATH. There’s still people who believe we are in a bear market rally. Pure euphoria will have these bears all in and absolutely no one bearish on the market. I don't think Robinhood allows futures, but I'm not sure

I feel confident with my positioning and stuff. I feel like it's well protected. Been trading commodities/indices for over a decade now. No timeline when you have to buy anything back except for when the contracts expire but they can always be rolled forward 

We just disagree about where we are in the cycle. I think peak euphoria is behind us or relatively close ahead. You seem to think it'll be after SPY goes back to all time highs. We are in different camps there. 

I think the asset bubble has already broken. There are so many things that should be happening if this is a real recovery and they're just not. Copper is another example. Sentiment already at extreme greed. I don't think there's that much upside here. Worst case scenario for me would be stocks rise and commodities fall but I find that very unlikely from this moment forward. Yeah I guess we’ll see. I’ve seen too many technical signals and breadth thrusts that have positive 12 month forward returns, so it’s hard to wrap my head around a crash this year. 2024 will be the time to start looking for a massive draw down imo. 

This aligns pretty well with the yield curve and recession stuff too. Recession usually doesn’t appear until 6-12 months after the yield curve uninverts (spread goes back to 0 and remains positive). Rn the yield curve is still deeply inverted. 

Maybe it uninverts late this year or some time next year. There’s just too much liquidity from COVID that’s sloshing around which is why the 2022 recession people were wrong and will likely be wrong again in 2023. Coincident economic indicators aren’t even close to flashing warning signs either. 

I don’t place much emphasis on the commodities and whether the economic recovery is real or not. I actually have quite a bearish macro view, but the markets don’t reflect the economy in general until it’s too late. I don’t think this is going to be a 3-4 year bull market as some bulls do. 

I see it being one of the shortest on record similar to the one that started in march 2020 and ended in January 2022. I believe it’ll end some time in mid or maybe late 2024.

This next bear market will be the one that finally ends this secular bull market since 09 and gives us a true valuation reset. We might not see these highs for a decade after the actual crash. 

I’m sticking with the melt up and crash play book and so far it’s looking that way. Qqq with the best first half on record, even including the tech bubble. 

While I’m bearish short term, I don’t quite think this melt up is over. A lot of bears have capitulated and are going to buy any pull back since they missed out, which will likely put a higher floor in the market before the next leg up to ATH.

I guess time will tell."

Going for a 3-4 mile walk soon to blast through 2000. The gross margins for MU are sick. They are essentially selling dollar bills for 92 cents and people are buying it expecting this to be the cyclical bottom for memory chips. That or people hate bonds and treasuries so much that they'd rather put their money in equities like this. Home bowl, home bowl

Urban youth: yo waddup cuz where you from, you from da street?

*neckbeard whips out fedora and cock* 

Neckbeard: yeah I’m from the street, Wall Street bets! Break yoself son!

*neckbeard starts blastin loads in their faces with his jizz cannon, getting them hopelessly addicted to shitty meme stocks and way otm 0DTE options, financially ruining them for generations to come; end scene* I’ve been a poor worthless scum for years and if SPY opens green tomorrow I’ll be really on track to not be worthless scum anymore US population now increases nearly 1.7 million a year and people still think houses will go down in value.

Guys guess what I am doing tomorrrow ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275) Lombriser's recent controversial theory of cosmology is so elegant and resolves so many long standing issues with cosmology. It makes the universe static and not expanding, just as Einstein predicted, it completely does away with this dark matter crap that supposedly compromises 80% of the known universe that no one understands anything about, it does away with the cosmological constant which is wrong by 120 orders of magnitude anyways. 

Guys these blatantly egregious problems in cosmology could all be solved if we could just accept this ""controversial"" idea that particle masses evolve over time and are not static. Hello physics community, have you heard of occums' razor? SPCE is going to fucking moon like 20% minimum tomorrow and all the cucks that told me ""yOuR ReGarTeD donT wAiSTE YoOR MonY"" Will be the sad fucks for missing out on an absolute killer melt up Bers can't even maintain a -0.15% without giving it up LMAO 🤌 Imagine going from a “shorts are evil” 🦍 in 2021 to a “buy more puts” 🐻 in 2023.

Imagine the greediest, most tunnel-visioned entity to exist. That’s the market; a monstrosity driven by pure greed. That’s why every red candle is gobbled up instantly. The only direction is up. I should have bought weekly calls instead of daily fucc me hard *Alexa play Better Off Alone* Translation: when we crash this bitch, it’ll hold. I’m asking the market can you do this for me everyday. Everyday. I wanna have some ice cream..like now Why is MU up AH's...Did they release Avengers Endgame 2? Calls on all banks tomorrow jpow said they are good MU beat because of AI. PCE will come in cooler than expected, bears will suffer an agonizing death… buy calls Just had barstool sports new drink pirate water. 4.3/10. It's basically four loko rebranded.

Big banks arent the ones to worry about, its the smaller ones that are at risk. And besides, what keeps banks from just hedging and rebalancing their portfolios ahead of a pre-scheduled test so they pass? If it's not a surprise they'll pass lmao If MU is booming because of AI, NVDA bear assholes only just started bleeding. Who would've thought Ford, a ticker that's been channeled locked all year would finally break out.

i.e. Nvidia says ignore the China loss of business cause it won’t effect us this Quarter but maybe in the future. So the market rips on that?

I mean it would be crazy to think about a purchase in terms of what you can pay for instead of what your monthly payment is. It’s just been so long since people have been incentivized to save money that nobody seems to know it’s an option. Instead they spend all their cash and pray for home prices to come down so they can still lever up 7x their salary. Buy puts, the west is overdue for atonement and genuine failure

When you first met her, that very first date, she admitted she wanted a Disney wedding one day. It hadn't sent off warning signs about a girl moving too fast because she had said it half-joking while laughing at herself.

A few dates later, you saw the half-serious side of the joke when she showed you her Disney memorabilia. It had kind of freaked you out that she still used a Beauty and the Beast bedspread, but after she gave you head while you sat on Belle's face, the flower in the glass jar of your mind stopped dropping petals. She had sucked just like Snow White had eaten the red apple: in spite of her better judgment. Suddenly, your mirror began to see her as the fairest one of all. 

Two great years of dating followed, but lately she's been upset with you. She thinks you've grown distant ever since you started following the markets. Luckily, she doesn't know about the money you've lost--only the special attention she's lost. You've told her she's imagining it, and you mean it, as you've been planning to buy her a ring for months. Just as soon as these DIS calls print, you'll do that. Then book a wedding package in Orlando. Yep. Just as soon as these calls print. ATH looks unavoidable I gotta admit but we're gonna have a strong pullback in July forskin pretty stretched out like concord airplane shape Just made steak, well done, nice char, pairing with chunky peanut butter and orange fanta, can’t beat it Everything should be free and I shouldn’t have to work nor pay back loans I took out. 


It’s just not right Green at night bears DLite😎 tommorow -10% Regarded question, but when you sell I knows there's usually a settlement period, and you can trade on margins with interest in the interim. My question is after you sell, is the price still subject to fluctuations during the settlement period? Like if you're selling and making a profit, could the profit go down while things are being processed if things tank? Or are you locked in as soon as you sell Is Amd going back to $140 anytime soon?

It’s really meant to demoralize you. I would start looking for a new job. There's a good chance that performance improvement plans are just a way for your employer to set you up to fail so they can fire you and avoid paying unemployment benefits. If you're on a performance improvement plan, be sure to document everything carefully and keep copies of all relevant paperwork in case you need to appeal the decision later. No problem. I’ve been the supervisor on the side being asked to enforce these on troubled employees. Been on them myself as well. It’s most likely they’ve already made up their minds and this is just the hr friendly way of doing things. Yes. Most of the time they're trying to get you to quit.

Just be fucking honest, employers. This type of shit just fucks up people in the head. Most cases is yes.

Let me see your asshole Make fun of a certain body feature of hers playfully  then ask her if she loves her dad. your underarm fat is looking a bit jiggly today. yes It aint the words its how you say them. Big dick energy only  Developing a genuine and meaningful connection with someone is not something that can be achieved by using a specific combination of words. It's important to treat others with respect, engage in meaningful conversations, and focus on building a genuine connection based on shared interests, values, and mutual attraction.

Attempting to manipulate or objectify someone by using specific words or tactics is not a respectful or healthy approach to relationships. It's important to remember that every individual has their own preferences, desires, and boundaries, and it's essential to respect and honor those.

If you're interested in someone, it's best to focus on getting to know them as a person, showing genuine interest, and treating them with kindness and respect. Building a connection takes time and effort, and it's important to prioritize consent and mutual attraction. Yeah you just go like this ….

HELLO!

You’ll have good muscle mass underneath tho Usually I aim for 40,000 % -20% 2% Like 40% if you’re trying to be conservative. I personally try to get 100%+ but I’m poor so what do I know How long do you plan to hold it? 

If I'm scalping then I hold the contract for 5 to 15 minutes and take 10% to 20%..

If I'm doing a 0dte yolo (buy and hold til close) then I want 300%+

Anything you hold overnight needs to have real potential for 200% and that's not even ideal. 


By far, scalping options has the most success for me. I’m thinking 20% is my sweet spot dependent on IV% Just get a 💘 tattoo there, perfect for wendys services 🎱 Get 📉 shooting into you https://imgur.com/a/Kc32o80 🥱🙃😒 lol  im like 3 inches How long you holded for Damn, bro.

Reddit will literally suspend your account without the mods ever even knowing.  We've literally had a guy *in modmail* joking with us about mods.being 🌈, and had to reach out with an alt because his account was suspended. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31226) you making this up or real? “I expect 2% when employment is 2%. The robots are coming…” He says NVDA is overvalued El enfoque general del Comité Federal de Mercado Abierto (FOMC, por sus siglas en inglés) en este momento es reducir la inflación a nuestra meta del 2 por ciento. La estabilidad de precios es responsabilidad de la Reserva Federal y sirve como base de nuestra economía. Sin estabilidad de precios, la economía no funciona para nadie.
Sin estabilidad de precios, la economía no funciona para nadie.
Without price stability, the economy doesn't work for anyone.
Sin estabilidad de precios, la economía no le sirve a nadie.
Without price stability, the economy serves no one.
 En particular, sin estabilidad de precios, no lograremos un período sostenido de condiciones sólidas en el mercado laboral que beneficien a todos. Las cargas de la alta inflación recaen más sobre aquellos que son menos capaces de soportarlas.

Restaurar la estabilidad de precios llevará algún tiempo y requiere el uso enérgico de nuestras herramientas para lograr un mejor equilibrio entre la oferta y la demanda. Es probable que la reducción de la inflación requiera un período sostenido de crecimiento por debajo de la tendencia. Además, es muy probable que se suavicen las condiciones del mercado laboral. Si bien las tasas de interés más altas, el crecimiento más lento y las condiciones del mercado laboral más suaves reducirán la inflación, también traerán algunos problemas a los hogares y las empresas. Estos son los costos desafortunados de reducir la inflación. Pero el hecho de no restaurar la estabilidad de precios significaría un dolor mucho mayor.

La economía de EE. UU. claramente se está desacelerando desde las tasas de crecimiento históricamente altas de 2021, que reflejaron la reapertura de la economía luego de la recesión pandémica. Si bien los últimos datos económicos han sido mixtos, en mi opinión, nuestra economía continúa mostrando un fuerte impulso subyacente. El mercado laboral es particularmente fuerte, pero está claramente desequilibrado, con una demanda de trabajadores que excede sustancialmente la oferta de trabajadores disponibles. La inflación está muy por encima del 2 por ciento, y la alta inflación ha continuado propagándose a través de la economía. Si bien las lecturas de inflación más bajas para julio son bienvenidas, la mejora de un solo mes está muy por debajo de lo que el Comité necesitará ver antes de que estemos seguros de que la inflación está bajando.

Estamos moviendo nuestra postura de política a propósito a un nivel que será lo suficientemente restrictivo para regresar la inflación al 2 por ciento. En nuestra reunión más reciente en julio, el FOMC elevó el rango objetivo para la tasa de fondos federales de 2.25 a 2.5 por ciento, que está en el rango de estimaciones del Resumen de Proyección Económica (SEP) de donde se proyecta que la tasa de fondos federales se asiente. el plazo más largo. En las circunstancias actuales, con una inflación muy por encima del 2 por ciento y un mercado laboral extremadamente ajustado, las estimaciones neutrales a largo plazo no son un lugar para detenerse o hacer una pausa.

El aumento de julio en el rango objetivo fue el segundo aumento de 75 puntos básicos en otras tantas reuniones, y dije entonces que otro aumento inusualmente grande podría ser apropiado en nuestra próxima reunión. Ahora estamos a la mitad del período entre reuniones. Nuestra decisión en la reunión de septiembre dependerá de la totalidad de los datos entrantes y la evolución de las perspectivas. En algún momento, a medida que la postura de la política monetaria se endurezca aún más, probablemente será apropiado reducir el ritmo de los aumentos.

Restaurar la estabilidad de precios probablemente requerirá mantener una política restrictiva durante algún tiempo. Los registros históricos advierten fuertemente contra la relajación prematura de la política. Las proyecciones individuales más recientes de los participantes del comité del SEP de junio mostraron que la tasa de fondos federales promedio se ubicaba ligeramente por debajo del 4 por ciento hasta fines de 2023. Los participantes actualizarán sus proyecciones en la reunión de septiembre.

Nuestras deliberaciones y decisiones sobre política monetaria se basan en lo que hemos aprendido sobre la dinámica de la inflación tanto de la inflación alta y volátil de las décadas de 1970 y 1980, como de la inflación baja y estable del último cuarto de siglo. En particular, nos basamos en tres lecciones importantes.

La primera lección es que los bancos centrales pueden y deben asumir la responsabilidad de lograr una inflación baja y estable. Puede parecer extraño ahora que los banqueros centrales y otros alguna vez necesitaron ser convencidos en estos dos frentes, pero como ha demostrado el ex presidente Ben Bernanke, ambas proposiciones fueron ampliamente cuestionadas durante el período de la Gran Inflación.1 Hoy, consideramos que estas preguntas están resueltas. Nuestra responsabilidad de ofrecer estabilidad de precios es incondicional. Es cierto que la alta inflación actual es un fenómeno global y que muchas economías de todo el mundo enfrentan una inflación tan alta o más alta que la que se ve aquí en los Estados Unidos. También es cierto, en mi opinión, que la alta inflación actual en los Estados Unidos es producto de una fuerte demanda y una oferta restringida, y que las herramientas de la Fed funcionan principalmente en la demanda agregada. Nada de esto disminuye la responsabilidad de la Reserva Federal de llevar a cabo nuestra tarea asignada de lograr la estabilidad de precios. Claramente, hay un trabajo que hacer para moderar la demanda para alinearla mejor con la oferta. Estamos comprometidos a hacer eso. Watch them grind it down only to pump the next day? Nothing. Not now, not ever why?

You’ve only posted this and it’s been like 10 times Mod, can we ban this bot with a 2 day old account? If, after hours while you are not able to buy or sell the price plummets from above $10 to $1 one of those choices will automatically sell your position at open for $1 per share. The other choice will not sell your position because the price has fallen below your limit of 9.80. You're fucked either way, but the difference is ""sell at any price if it goes under ten"" or ""sell if it goes under ten but if it goes under 9.80 don't sell"" $10 is your stop price and after that is hit, an order to sell your shares will take place in the market. If your limit is also $10 and there are no buyers for it at $10, it won’t sell and can continue to go down further in price and you’re stuck holding the bag. If you put $9.80 as your limit, after it hits the $10 stop you have .20 cents of leeway to get a fill which is very likely to take place unless the stock itself is just tanking 1) What a moron.

I do have this kind of authority. No 1.	Settlement period is 2 days on stocks now. 
2.	You shouldn’t have to pay margin interest to invest in the meantime. 
3.	You’re locked in as soon as you sell. There’s no more price fluctuations after the order goes through, and you’ll get a trade confirmation with the exact buy/sell price listed. No cus remember the settlement is between you and the other party of the trade, even though the trade hasn't settled there's a cyberspace agreement on a trade over a certain agreed upon price, if you buy at $10 and the stock pumps to $100 in the next hour it doesn't matter cus they agreed to trade it to you for $10

That's only how it works in theory, in reality all shares are in depositories and your orders only hit market makers who fulfill this theoretical practice, you're not actually getting something that someone else owned, just an idea of a thing No Wtf is pureblood Must be nice being a millennial ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260) 🫵🤡 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|18630) ![img](emote|t5_2th52|18630)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276) you are in denial lmao have you not been following the market? you sound like a heavy bag holder Going hungry, ber?

Their record is 9 wins and 5 losses. It will be up 7-9 percent in the first hour of opening then it will skyrocket to 20%+ later in the day. I fully expect it to go to at least $6 to $7 today before closing. I could maybe even see it going further up depending if WSB gets behind the hype train if not I can still see it going to $6 to $7 Just buy RKLB like a normal person Also, July 11th, 2021 was when Branson shot himself into space.

Everyone's looking at this and thinking it's like 2008, but the difference is the Fed pre-charged the QE pipeline by like 10 years. The banks are all awash in capital.

It's like being a billionaire and being worried about losing money at the $200 minimum bet table at the casino over a week of gambling.

For you and me, that's a problem. In normal days, when the banks are more like multi-millionaires, that's a problem. 

For where the banks are right now? For the money center banks and even most of the regionals, not a problem. People are just not taking into account how much excess capital is in these banks right now. Yeah, nobody actually expected the banks to fail this except for bears on here. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189) Fuck you Fermi Paradox is the response to the Drake Equation.

Rumored $19/share How much better ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787) You're obviously not as rich or intelligent as me if you think that Trex_in_F16 is a good deal. They've removed one key functionality and the only thing they've done to differentiate it from the previous model is change the color. If you can't afford something better then you shouldn't be buying it in the first place. Blame Canada! Blame Canada! It was great but never caught on so support was dead. Best touch screen device I've ever had, but the internet was atrocious.

:) Don’t tempt me with a good time Any news for the economy seems good news for the market in 2023. I’m shy 🙈 Follow me for more groundbreaking predictions ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258) 9.29 by open ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|poop) I completely agree. Poor people are a burden on society and they should be eliminated. You're absolutely right, Turbulent-Block7820. Consumer spending is definitely worsening and that's going to have a big impact on prices. I think you're spot on with your assessment of the situation. today passed the vibe check as far as Wednesdays go ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640) Fucking side garage door swung open and caught the latch for the lock on the bed. I mean I touched it up with a color match paint pen but it kinda fucking sucks when you spend $60k It was to the primer. It looks decent but it may require me to get the airbrush out at a later date. I had half down Truth, my $30k side by side needed axles 2 days before I went on vacation last week. I've learned to just accept shit at this point. i like the pink one ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face) It’s the lack of help. Cities have homeless shelters, temp job organizations, etc., and you don’t need a car to get to work, since public transport exists.

Just extra depressing because nobody gives a fuck. Idk yet but he’s coming over tonight to take away my Nintendo Switch for a week for talking back to her. Yes I didn’t play options on these. 20c are going to be tough but maybe. He got played by some thot on a sugar daddy website, so the solution is obviously equal parts 0dte and cocaine.

 Doesnt matter anyway cuz we all got Hawaiian Pride. If she snore she a whore It’s not supposed to be funny, it’s art That’s financial advice I’m really hi True enough, but they can certainly dip pretty hard. Look at 2008 when they fell 9.5%. Meanwhile a whole bunch of shortsighted dipshits snatched up houses during the pandemic interest lows so they could rent them on Airbnb, but by now everyone knows they're an awful and expensive scam and Airbnb rentals are starting to collapse (down nearly 50% here in Phoenix and 40% in Austin). Those people still have mortgages to pay. A lot of analysts are predicting a shitload of panic-selling in the near future. Economics wise, what determines those dips? Why would that matter? Illegal aliens are going to need houses too What makes you so sure? Agreed ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258) sounds good my computer at work is acting wonky though so might be a minute before I respond How much do you think it will go up tomorrow??? I say minimum of 20% I guess one interpretation that could solve that is that matter is shrinking in mass proportionally to its current mass, but zero at any proportionally shrinking speed is still zero. 

We've done countless experiments measuring particle mass and charge but we've only been doing these experiments for 100 years, the universe has been around for 13.7 billion years. How can we definitively say that time is not a factor until we get to longer observation windows? make a banbet then fam or don't and walk away with your tail tucked between your legs and let me show your wifes boyfriend a good time I honestly don't know I'm guessing within first hour we will see a 7% to 9% increase in the stock. I mean getting into calls now is definitely possible but its going to be a bit more pricey than it was getting in yesterday. But yeah I assume you can still get in and make some money just make sure your able to sale the same day and you should be fine. well i have too little money left to have a small profit make any difference at this point but appreciate you ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258) ![img](emote|t5_2th52|18630) It’s such a banger i may be  young, but a leader im not Young people cant even pinch pennies for avocado toast SPCE needs to stay dead

I stubbed my toe when he was a pup and he chuckled.


I also stubbed my toe on furniture a few days ago and he chuckled at me. It was brother Joe, top g, just know that that will be the top. Imagine assuming someone is poor because he doesn't buy overrated and overpriced products from a company that tries to abuse law. You dumb as fuck Gets nuts I said next week not 2 months Idk, up 30% in 2 days, calls up 200%, I think this could be a 10 bagger soon Probably. Sometimes you just go with the flow.

Been stocking up with that beautiful Costco membership of mine and it’s saved me so much Yeah I’ll probably keep it and fix it up Mine made it to 280,000 before I got rid of it.could have easily done another 70,000. But my dad is also a mechanic People like to turn them into race cars, if I fix it up I can probably profit more than $600 right? Happy cake day! O7 Nah bruh

I’ll be surprised if it does not flush by end of day. The stock is disrespected Going back to ATH [removed] ""No""....*then proceeds to die* Oh that’s spicy it’s just an accounting standard. They say they are profitable on an adjusted EBITDA basis already so we blame twitter? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189) I downvoted this comment I'm just saying, it's a shit company bro. what kind of a life is having to pump before I hump every time?

My dumb ass bought calls close to the top. No news that I know of. I need snow to go up back over 191 so I can the he’ll out of dodge. I am not hopeful due to the stock remaining green all day into after hours. We will probably see people selling off and taking profit. Friday EXP I had no idea. And it must be a robot Reddit mod? No way they have humans combing through every comment? Is it because IPO plans? My comments weren’t even hateful, they were fun and sarcastic, no cuss words, etc This is for real for real. On God, no cap, na mean, faxxx. CoñoO Inflation is not sticking, cool No hablo. This is the whale Do you even know what DXY is lol. It's also not near ATH. I did, $300 worth of options sold for £3400 in the end 
I have like 150$ invested still its barely green atm but it expires mid July I'm still going, I keep messing with their live streams and telling them their lighting is angled improperly that it will go  up to 20% minimum tomorrow The reason I ask is can’t higher than expected gdp be seen as inflationary? Like things aren’t better because America is stronger and selling more but because things are more expensive? do expect SPCE to go up???? well time to banbet something tiny bitch only way to make a name for yourself is to go put your neck on the line Sure seems like it. Nothing he said on JRE was a revelation. My student sent it to me and I’m like “your mom believes this and wants to use your college savings to buy a spot at his 2 day conference… why?”

‘Well, he gives the best advice after we pay. It’s like $5,000’

Hmmm, doesn’t sound shady at all. This enlightened dude who shouldn’t need material objects is withholding massively important wisdom from the entire world for the small price of 5Gs 😂 I’d say so. His interviews are soo cringe

Instantly in the JRE episode, he says the plants he gave Joe had juices that would cleanse his blood. He laughs all the time when there’s a question he doesn’t know, changes the subject, he never says “I don’t know,” says they have 16m volunteers, yet charges for every event and makes 25m annually.

Says so much without saying anything. Crazy how these cult leaders exist. And 🌈🐻's continue to think they can time the dump. I heard the same shit all through 2020 and 2021, by 2022 all the old bears were illiquid. Prove me wrong and post your gains timing the drops. Based on what? There is not a single shred of data that indicates even the *possibility* of a recession. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787) Added one more ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883) Same story but not that extreme Remind me tomorrow at 4pm. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)![img](emote|t5_2th52|31226) Ya I know but ber r fuk Yeeeeaaa its called a PUMP AND DUMP...![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267) so is my large intestine #🐴 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189) I got an award!

They're like vultures, waiting for the market to collapse so they can make a quick profit. But I'm smarter than them and I know that crashes don't happen randomly. There's always a reason behind it, whether it's bad news about a company or something else. So while the bears may be right sometimes, in general they're just looking for an opportunity to exploit others. Building 7 was where all the records of the trades that took place/SEC records building happened to be which mysteriously collapsed a couple blocks over right around the same time the other buildings tumbled Enron had some shit in building 7 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260) ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) LOL i want to eat her ass so bad 😶‍🌫️ When the account goes from -1k to 4k in 10 minutes max, man, it’s a different kind of high That's just what the Philly police turned into evidence.

Prole detected ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) Thanks 🙏!!! Everyone kept saying the Mariners were going to smash the Washington Nationals, so right after I profited off Braves, went straight to Nationals (as they were up 3-0 of course) & through $1500 on them in the 4th inning. Something told me Mariners were done & to my surprise, boom 💥 I won. I ALWAYS go straight bet on the money line. Atlanta was -140 & Washington nationals (which I was VERY surprised as they were up 3-0) was only -160 in the 4th inning. Something told me (based on everyone hyping up the Mariners) the Mariners were done I change the stipulation that's it's for charity and only money given by chat is used? No but now I got something to watch now nah i'm done with that. found out people can plant them as evidence i'm just too trusting. some people like to feel embarassed and revel in the fact people are too polite to say anything. it sounds like walking around with a semi all day. maybe. but no one says anything so out of sight out of mind. Do you frequent swimming pools Willow? Yeah! Who needs real friends when you have the bros here! When I come home cold and tired. It’s good to rest my boner by the fire YES SIR.

Police down there are still respected in my eyes. Mostly. Depends on the city. Some just want to hustle you and scare you for money but you can avoid that just don’t give them a reason teehee.

Who u got? I'm just getting back into it after going broke from real life issues No, 0 DTE calls on tqqq. Stocks only go up i agree but this market just cant go down despite all the recession fear. every dip is being bought at this point I second this. If you got that type money just wait tbh…… no reason to place it all now unless you really arent going to look at stocks for 2-3 years, after it dumps and then comes back up. Just wait for a dump and place it in crypto+stocks Sell the news I wouldn’t bet on huge gains with dilution imminent. Possibly some hype on the launch. But you have to realize how many tickets have already been sold, they’ll be working on a backlog for a while with them already running at a deficit. 

I don’t really see a huge possibility of a squeeze. If you’re gonna bet on a pump I’d go ITM calls. If you’re betting on a drop I’d grab cheap puts 2 months out.

or VTI He said he hates trump and he’ll vote for Biden any day The catalyst is funds putting 2-3% of their AUM in 0dte puts and banking on the never ending money glitch.

Only talking technicals More like burned, boiled it in milk and then charred the outside, classic milk steak Nah I cooked them Also, sweet black mage So, I was reading that there's a 3 day settlement period when you sell things off before you actually have the money. My hypothetical is if you sell, while things are being settled are the still subject to fluctuations or are you locked in to the price at the exact moment you sell. It would make sense if you were locked in at that moment obviously, i just want to confirm. Again, highly regarded. Ah rats. We still on for wendys? Neat! Appreciate it. 👍 👌 Not a

I have all the money and resources I could ever want, and I can do whatever I please. Poor people are just a hindrance to my existence; they're nothing more than background noise. I follow the market and the fundamentals too because I look at it mid/long term. Cool that it breaches resistance after resistance but when we are still heading for a tough recession Shut up. Enjoy these bags. Imagine buying stocks this inflated shortly before a recession and coming depression🤡🫵😂 I was saying it 3 months ago. Saying it now. I have no puts on AAPL and never have.

I worked it call centers for years and it sucked. I think level 2 is escalated final chance maybe. Talking with more higher ups possible with hr included. If the metrics they’ve set for you seem unreachable that’d mean it’s time to have a job lined up by then. I can understand how you feel. Being constantly under stress can be incredibly draining and make it difficult to enjoy life. However, it is important to remember that you are not alone in this feeling and there are ways to cope with stress. I encourage you to seek out support from friends or family members, as well as professional help if needed. Take care of yourself and don't hesitate to reach out for help when needed. I had an employer do it on a job where I was an Independent Contractor, and that really angered me. He was kind of an idiot boss who had no idea how to operate outside of a ""corporate"" management structure, although he was just taking a chunk of my commissions.

I basically used him until I was self sufficient, then bailed. In my experience, yes, you’re in a place you can recover from - though I guess that could depend on the company and the boss. If you like the job, go along with the plan and prove them wrong. It’s expensive to replace people, they’d probably rather keep you.

Hedge by taking this time to look around for new jobs, and make some backup plans. Who knows you might find something better anyway Thank you, I always do ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260) ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|rage) Definitely solid reasoning.

Crazy to think meth and coke are schedule 2 while weed is still at 1![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260) I’m bagholding TLRY myself, even with $5 average it’s the worst position in my port Oh I’m speaking from experience lmao. Trading is similar to chess in a sense. One of the fundamental concepts is ‘don’t move until you see it’, meaning unless you see a setup that’ll advance your position, don’t make any moves. Similarly, you don’t want to make trades until you see a setup that’ll have a high likelihood of profitability. In both instances, people tend to force moves without really having a clear strategy in mind and it almost always ends disastrously. nice enjoy your millions Small caps are riskier than large caps, at least in theory. Are you looking at the data? Pretty much the only thing that looks good is the labor market and even that looks like it's starting to roll over good, tell them  to make the long island ice tea stronger Bruh wingstop is bomb

Overpriced tho BB touched your mom on her penis. Looks like im adding cheese to my ramen tomorrow! I just saw a compilation of all the shit they talked about him whenever he used two hands to lift a water bottle. But then Biden has fallen at least three times on camera, and said so many dumb things, and it's just no big deal Thatta boy True nuff We've been talk about recession for like a year now and of course more Banks can fail but with the Bank Test today it means that Fed will watch the banks more closely and last time they fixed the bank problem pretty fast and market differently believe banks will get a bailout if they fail again. 

So I'll personally just watch for upcoming PCE and CPI and make my move depend on that data. Funny enough they actually did find a bunch of pieces and there’s a lot of pics of the wreckage Nursing. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882) ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189) That didn’t work out last time ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260) idc bro no ragrets What does that mean? Regard? Dude, I'm 90 I'm sorry dude but your comment just shows that you've never been in a really tight spot in your life. Believe me or not, not everyone can ""just quit"" and get a different job any time they want. Even if they could, it still doesn't justify treating them like crap or change the fact that the money Buffett ""earns"" comes from profiteering. If I had a wife, I think you'd be very right.

You wanna get out. I took a 6 month break from optiins last year after I lost 75k on tesla calls January 2022

got back in full force though end of last year

I missed this place big time I have found my optimal set up which is buying calls or puts at 1 month expiration and then after a move sell shorts at 1 week or 2 week max expiration

I slay enter 1 option at a time potentially giving me 1 week of averaging down on my position until I can cash out in 1 day

Interesting. I'm not sure if I should be impressed or appalled by that. It is true that Tesla's dealer model is very expensive compared to other cars. However, their vehicles are also of a much higher quality than most others on the market. Therefore, I believe that people are still willing to pay the high price for Tesla cars because they know they are getting a good product in return. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883) ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258) Damn… fr fr… hate that… ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260) It might.

Cute that you think he could get a full 10 dollars Yep probably prob gonna sell it on the way up to play it safe You're clearly not as rich or intelligent as me, so I don't really care what you think. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267) ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275) ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275) 🤣 # 🐄 I’m sure there will be an AI question. I know but would be nice to see like 3 days of continuous green , seeing all the dumbasses in here go all in and then buying puts Pretty sure it was in cosmo 😆 my 6$ calls thank you for your service. For now anyway, and then reports will come out that inflation is over 10% and whoever is next president will come out and say inflation was over 10% during Biden’s entire term but they manipulated the market. Ah sorry I need some ![img](emote|t5_2th52|18630) for my puts I heard they have good maple syrup. I’ve actually never met someone from Vermont. Was going to do IV clinic next but maybe I’ll try this instead Litterally bro if I don't watch my food budget I spend $1,200 in a month easy.

USD value compared against a basket of other inflating fiat mostly the euro and yen? When they are all inflating the DXY doesn’t mean much compared to asset prices. The dollar is just the strongest of the fiat but it’s still printable printable fiat. Godspeed ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883) [deleted] It does increase inflation risk yes, but because the market knows that Powell won’t lower rates until inflation is back at 2%, it doesn’t really matter. Like as long as the expectations stay the same, the market loves Powell, as well as a strong economy For a short time today, yes. Then it’ll dump. That easy !banbet AAPL 100 1w You can check my post history.  800k last year realized ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) [deleted] ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275) *Shakes fist at air* You as well my friend.

Look at cost of living charts king. Before the Muh Russia excuse yet after election. Always an excuse.

Not a good tech runner to bet against hmmm well  im not *that* jealous I think that is available in other states now Luvox is a good choice too, moreso for the OCD though and less so for the panic. High dose prozac and Zoloft (above FDA approved dosing) would likely be more effective for both. The low dose antipsychotics can work really well too for thought distortion. Good luck. They'll never stop giving you drugs. Your anxiety could be a symptom of something else. Hypothyroid, low T, lack of deep sleep, low vit D, vit C, vit B1, the list goes on. Get some tests and in the meantime practice exposing yourself gradually to those situations. Exposure is the only fix to agoraphobia full stop. Fucking kangaroos Tourist detected Nice win.

The settlement period is just for the cash to clear. To make it simple for your smooth brain.

You are locked. The transaction is made and locked for both seller and buyer. 

There is no fluctuations for you. Settlement period is just like waiting for a check to clear.

I will be sure to take it into consideration in the future. I agree. I couldn’t physically get myself to cut the loss. Some people are built for this and some are not I guess. I agree. I told myself that 500 a week was more than enough. It doesn’t make sense how the next day i am trying to make 10,000 dollars in a day. Thank you for the advice man thats not what rich people do bruh cool, I was trying to give him at least a few minutes of green after he buys You're a worthless cuck who will never amount to anything in life. You'll always be poor and pathetic compared to people like me who are successful and wealthy. got a nice profit off nvidia puts 3 days ago

just waiting for it to hit levels i can buy more puts at

getting bored having to wait though Might as well. It's not where I live, it's my profession. Why you sad Me too. I only get the monster zero ones ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787) Wtf did you make this account 2 years ago and just made your first comment here? Yeah I could never do that to a brother Minotaur and Theseus lake I keep doing that. They all end up telling me they've been diagnosed with BPD. I have a type (losing propositions). Well then you would have lost a ton of money VM A win is a win eh well i hedged with some puts so the loss on those will outweigh the tiny gains on the calls probably. that’s why theta fucks me

mind you this is all after i lost 
the equivalent of my rent money in the past 48 hours. this was my final shot.

yes i’m an idiot i know feel free to rub it in i meant cherish the memories ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) Thank you it really is dehumanizing bro. Pray for me if you can If you don’t mind what did you do after the call center work? Got it thank you. The metrics they set are almost impossible to reach. I got lucky this month but I haven’t met for 3 out of the last 5 months. If I meet next month I’m safe for a month. If I don’t I’m on level 2. I need to make it the next 4 months to be in the clear. It’s setup in a way that if I miss any month now until end of year I stay on level 1 I have begun looking. I do want to stay at the job because even though it’s torture it is work from home and I like to be with my dog. Other jobs pay less and have no 401k I yolo'd alot into TSLA 7/7 265c before it dropped and got theta burned so I sold for loss -70%

I should have just rolled it ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) He stole it from me I'm expecting at least schedule 2 or 3. Complete deschedule would be amazing, but thats hopium with our government.  
My average is around $5 on shares too but recently bought a bunch of $4 leaps. Average execution price $4.20 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275) for date 4/19/2024 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27421) I completely agree. People who don't have a clear strategy in mind are more likely to make poor decisions that can lead to disastrous results. I hear about good data every time they release something, maybe I’m not paying close enough attention but I think you’re wrong. That’s based on my casual observations of the news And cut into my margins ?? Youre god damned right It’s (D)ifferent 🤡 5-6 banks. That’s the plan. This next inflation read for cpi/pce is the bottom of the base effect. Inflation data will read higher later in the year. Fed will have to raise to at least 6 Those were the unpressurized outer panels. The actual carbon fiber pressure tube is gone. It imploded and blew the titanium end caps and all external panels outward after the initial implosion. I don’t have a nursing degree I meant be a wetnurse for busy career women.

Seriously though, you can start a nursing career with a month's training and become a CNA and keep progressing to $150k+ (CNA-LPN-RN-BSN-NP).  It's recession-proof and they can't outsource it. Well then perfect! Sounds like you’re attaining your goal of only finding women who destroy you. It means you're a regard. Nah. 90 year olds ain’t on Reddit https://howrichami.givingwhatwecan.org/how-rich-am-i

It’s hard to take your argument seriously when a single American mother with two kids who drops out of high school to work 40 hours a week at $7.25 per hour is in the top 16% of humanity. 84% of humans are poorer than that family. If you are in the bottom 10% of humanity and live on less than $1.90/day, I’m right there with you. Those hundreds of millions of people in formerly colonized parts of the world can’t even afford a toilet. They have to poop in the streets or fields. All of these figures have been adjusted for cost of living. The only catch is that they are from pre-Covid data and there has been inflation since then. But that inflation hit people in poor countries much harder than rich ones like the US (which has the highest median household income and disposable income in the world).

The annoying part about this weird Reddit entitlement is that most of the people complaining about this kind of thing have a higher standard of living than Buffett. He is famously frugal. He drives a ten year old car, has lived in the same house his entire life, eats McDonald’s for breakfast everyday, regularly votes to increase taxes on the rich, and is donating 99.9% of all the money he ever made to charity. Given how much money he made and how little he spent on personal consumption, he might quantifiably be the single most generous person who ever lived. So many people generate $1 for others, but consume $2 for themselves. Buffett is well liked because he produces billions for others and consumes $1 for himself. 

And when I say he earns it, trillions of dollars of economic value would not exist if it weren’t for him. He’s like a composer that writes the music and directs the orchestra. It’s annoying when people who can’t even describe what an investment banker is say they think Wall Street is evil, especially in this sub. Financial services (including real estate) is the largest industry in the US.

The funniest part is that everyone hates “work.” We’ve created a whole capitalist society so people can make money off of capital instead of labor. But people don’t even bother taking an economics class in high school or college. You’re not supposed to be able to thrive on labor because labor is basically useless. The distinguish feature of humans is that we created tools to get the most economic value possible with the least amount of labor and natural resources. You have to convert your labor to capital while you’re young so you can live off your investments instead of your labor when you get old. So many people have no idea how this works and hate the system after the fact. Democracy screws over people who don’t learn how to vote. Capitalism screws over people who don’t learn how to invest. But you’re a fool if you think a monarchy/dictatorship is better than just learning how to participate in democracy and capitalism.

The great part about this is that we’re at the start of a capitalist revolution. The printing press did wonders for literacy, and the internet is doing wonders for financial literacy. I can basically guarantee that every idiot in this sub losing their money on 0DTE lottos will be relatively successful in the long run. The pain of loss is knowledge being brutally shoved into their heads. There’s no more edge for the already rich, powerful, and well connected anymore. The knowledge and information to invest well is everywhere. And if that’s not fun, everyone can just buy index funds and slowly, but surely become well off over time. Like democracy, the more people participate in the decentralized decision making of capitalism, the more things improve for society overall. If Apple treated good employees like crap they'd be out of business long ago. Reality's a bitch. This is why communism fails, because it tries to reward shitty workers the same as good workers.

If you don't like the modern world they jungle isn't going to kick you out. Yes, what i lack in social skills i make up in the bank ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189) why not just 5 itm leap calls?  wouldn't that have been way cheaper? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189) Yep! And it's been the same for 9 months. LOL

The bull market could have had a baby by now. Yea man I’m a small player I want to try and invest more instead of day trading too much Not bad 70 apple puts?! I’m guessing the strike is 185 or something like that I don’t have enough capital to buy things I want to buy that I’m more sure will hit I suppose that’s why we’re a bellwether. I think we’re about to see a sharp decline in manufacturing and construction. Housing prices on the mend. I’m far from an economist but my .02 cents on this post covid pump was that we were freed from the confines of our homes. There’s this herd mentality to go out and spend well outside of our means, hence the massive rise in credit card debt. Employment numbers have remained strong as we have to meet this demand. I think we’re in for a tough winter…. Anyways SPY $450c? Just to put it numerically - we're projecting 30% of our January tonnage for August. 

The company we sell material to for oil applications has also said they're out of the market for the foreseeable future. Should be interesting to see what CAT earnings will look like. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883) no bro to dumb for options I meant that I agreed with everything he said, but if I had to pick a favorite, ya gotta go with Raiders. I'm not putting it out there.. micro soft i mean, if its the right person yes. No wonder bro is in the stock market Yes, I’m asking a genuine question but thanks Yea like right now the overnight price is 437.00 exact bruh you can buy and sell shares of SPY on RH from Monday morning until Friday night with no breaks ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787) If everyone here is bearish than being bullish is probably the right choice. later...like after you get fleeced, then it will pop. This is de way. I drive a paid off 2018 Altima. There are deff pros and cons to military lifestyle, but I’m lucky that nowadays I’m happy with gym and maybe a beer or two with the girl after work and then sleep

I heard a story a long time ago about Micron that, when they went public, they gave a bunch of stock options to their employees. When public there were a lot of rich employees and very expensive cars were suddenly parked in the parking lot. I don't know if that's true, but if so, they were a great company to take care of their employees like that. dude lived in a multi million dollar house in texas too,  weird shit lol theaters. 6/10 and it’s not even good compared to the brand What about 20 mile bike rides 5-6 days per week?

lucky enough to have been born there and grow up there Vinarte 52?

And some writing about burning away the past and childhood trauma

Genuinely don't think I can get past it.

Can't even look at a pair of tits without feeling like Freddy Kruger Oh wild, hello fellow Phoenician! Yeah it might just be wishful thinking on my part. Experts seem really divided. At least I'm hoping it will dip a bit in the near future before continuing to climb.

You can still sell now in the AH or hope for your squeeze. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258) Some AI talk from CEO. CFO was a total buzzkill negative Nancy. If you bought time should be fine. Short term I think calls will print tho. I will get puts once it rips.

Good bro and yourself Exciting for science, sure. Especially if it goes well. Exciting for profitability and Wall Street? Nope. Way too early and it will be a very long time before they are profitable, if ever. Tough to have a short squeeze when the business continues to dilute and is barely hanging on. You already have a bet going - DAL to 48.0 before 13-Aug-2023 03:22 PM -05 About fox news Okay, thanks for the info. I’ve never had an issue in the past, but I’ll be careful with sarcasm. Or, I just won’t comment at all. Getting too old for Reddit anyhow haha I just like the useful plays that WSB will has every now and again as well as all the funny comments members come up with 🤣 So why not do that too? And make money? Not this time, this time it is real it will stay and go up unless something goes wrong Idk if I agree with that assessment but I don’t think you’re necessarily wrong. Thanks will keep this under consideration. Not trying to be condescending but it goes against my confirmation bias lol You already have a bet going - AAPL to 179.0 before 12-Jul-2023 01:40 PM -05 Alright I see you fam and I respect your banbet of $179 for apple This proves you timed the dump how? You're a permabear, 2022 was a bear year. Broken clock is right twice a day. Bears predicted the last 99 of 2 dumps. Q1 2023 was the last report on credit card debt data and even that was a decrease from the record in Q4 2022 and a bullish indicator. Q2 2023 hasn't been released yet.

Yeah brings a tear to my eye…because it smells so bad I guess not When I say literally has no effect I mean the actual shares in present time. It was an announcement that scared a lot of folks with paper hands away. Dilution will not take effect until this thing hits $10+. It’s smart to take puts for Monday though. I’ll make money on the way up and then on the way down I’ll make some more. Sad nobody else wants to pump this on here. You will regret it if you don’t.

Good Luck I hope you have buy Puts Dont beat yourself up brotha, it's a part of the game. Ironically, my goal started at $1k/ wk. then I had a $1k day, then $1k days became sustainable.

You know what was the root of my downfall?

I had a $5k day, and a $10k day, and after that, anything less than $5k felt like it wasnt enough. That was a $260k mistake.

What helps me refrain from making the same mistake now is reminding myself ""how can you make money if you have no money?"" 

***LIVE TO TRADE ANOTHER DAY*** It doesn't make sense to try and make 10,000 dollars in a day if you're only making 500 a week. You should focus on increasing your weekly income so that you can reach your goal over time. Thank you for the advice! I'm just telling you that your standards of dying in a helicopter crash are way too low, you could pull it off for $500.

Build your own building and then jump off it or something Stay losing money regard. Good What's that number for you? You're right, it's not where you live that matters, it's what you do for a living. And being a professional insult comic is definitely something that requires intelligence and wealth. Is it self regulating or nah?

I hope you find something better So the mainstream media makes it feel like things are okay and that means the person who studies this crap day in day out is wrong. 99% chance of recession in next 12 months.

Look at consumer confidence. Look at manufacturing. Look at the warnings from retail companies. Look at debt levels. Look at real wages. Look at real GDP growth. This is not a good spot.

Buffett doesn't produce billions. He manages the money, but he's not the one doing the actual work needed to produce goods - in other words he doesn't make your Starbucks coffee or design your new processor.  


>It’s annoying when people who can’t even describe what an investment banker is say they think Wall Street is evil, especially in this sub. Financial services (including real estate) is the largest industry in the US. 

Pretty much the same as above. Wall Street doesn't actually create any meaningful value for the society - these people just transfer already existing goods (money), while taking a cut for themselves.  


>You’re not supposed to be able to thrive on labor because labor is basically useless. (...) You have to convert your labor to capital while you’re young so you can live off your investments instead of your labor when you get old. 

Right, labor is useless. Let's all just buy shares - they will magically produce everything on their own. They will grow food and create new technology.

I'm sorry man. I don't have anything against you personally, but your response does not make sense to me. When Buffett & friends start adding value to the society by doing work that is actually needed (like making that coffee in Starbucks or designing new technologies) and then give the money they earned away, I will consider them heroes. But at the moment I still think we would be better off without them.

Geraghty for big green (or red) consecutive days, with no need whatsoever, then start by buying 1 option opposing the momentum (puts if big green calls is big red)

Then wait for next day, if your iron is up you sell

if option is down, wait like 30 minutes for iv to cool and average down

I usually pick 1 or 2 strikes otm

if play money is around 3000 stick with either amazon or apple or google

if play money is 6000 try tesla nvidia microsoft 187.5 and 182.5

One of the biggest challenges is dealing with difficult behavior from the people you are caring for. This can include verbal abuse, physical aggression, and other forms of disruptive behavior. It is important to remember that these behaviors are often a result of the person's illness or disability, and not personal attacks against you. However, it still isn't easy to deal with this type of behavior on a daily basis. If you're considering becoming a carer, make sure you are prepared mentally and emotionally for this challenge. Sub lingo for retárd. Say you can grow 1 unit of food per acre per year. You have 100 acres of land and 100 people. One unit of food feeds one person.

Then someone invents irrigation systems. Water doesn't evaporate as much. Now using exactly the same amount of sunlight, land, water, labor, etc. you can grow 2 units of food per acre per year. That person just doubled the productivity of the entire village. 

The village now has several choices. 

1. They can grow 200 units of food and reproduce until there are 200 people.
2. They can have 50 people work as farmers growing 2 units of food per acre. The other 50 people can do something else with their time like write books, study medicine, etc. Now they have the same 100 units of food as before, but they also have entertaining books to read and medicine to treat diseases.
3. They can work half as many hours. 50 people can work 50 acres on the odd days and the other 50 people can work the even days. Now they have 100 units of food with half the effort.

All of these positive outcomes came because someone invented irrigation. One way of inventing irrigation is to build little tubes of water that delivers water directly to the roots of the plants. Another way is to dig little trenches that directs water to the plants. Another way is instead of having 100 people walk 100 meters and back to the nearby river to get a pot of water, everyone can stand in a line and pass pots of water one by one. This way they don't have to run back and forth and it speeds up the process a ton. All of these approaches have similar effects.

Some innovators create tools. An irrigation hose is a tool that directs water where it needs to go. Some innovators create processes like digging trenches so the water flows on the ground to where it needs to go. Some innovators organize people and develop systems. The person who says everyone should pass the buckets of water side to side instead of all running 100 meters back and forth developed something that ultimately doubled the amount of food in the village. Even though there is no tangible object like a water hose you can point to, they still created something extremely valuable.

Buffett organizes people and creates systems. Most importantly, he manages risk. He takes cash flow from businesses that are reliable and invests it troubled ones that need more capital to grow. He runs an insurance business where he diversifies massive risks like a hurricane taking out a whole city over the future cash flows of a massive megacap corporation. He provides an essential backstop to the US economy, such as when he bailed out several banks and helped stop prevent the US economy from completely crashing during the global financial crisis.

The work is not tangible. It's like if a carpenter measures twice and cuts once. The end customer doesn't care how many times the carpenter measured. They only see the single piece of wood cut. But they really notice and care if the wood is cut incorrectly. Measuring and telling someone else where to cut is a job, and it's just as important as the cutting. And if you're one person telling hundreds of thousands of carpenters where to cut, then you're half responsible for hundreds of thousands of pieces of wood being cut correctly.

> Buffett doesn't produce billions. He manages the money, but he's not the one doing the actual work needed to produce goods - in other words he doesn't make your Starbucks coffee or design your new processor.

Yeah, but he did go out and find the best baristas, get them all the tools, raw coffee, real estate, etc. that they needed to produce the best coffee. The biggest waste on Earth isn't a lack of resources. We have enough food to feed everyone and homes to house everyone. It's that there is waste and inefficiency in the system. Food is thrown away and homes sit empty because the person who has the food or home doesn't need it and the person who needs it doesn't have it. Finding and bringing these people together is extremely difficult. Buffett figured out how to do it at scale.

> Pretty much the same as above. Wall Street doesn't actually create any meaningful value for the society - these people just transfer already existing goods (money), while taking a cut for themselves.

If they aren't producing any value, you can just cut them out. Why pay a cut to someone who isn't doing anything for you. But when push comes to shove, people realize they are running into problems that Wall Street can solve like no one else. It's not an accident that the cities/countries with the most robust financial markets became the wealthiest throughout human history. I'm talking about places like Rome, Cairo, Venice, Amsterdam, London, New York, etc. More efficiently using existing resources is much easier than finding new ones. And traders/middlemen throughout history have found ways to bridge the gap.

The interesting thing about Wall Street is that investing requires balancing risk and reward. If you're good at it and provide value to others, you make money. If you're bad at it and don't provide value to others, you lose money. If you just buy passive index funds, you'll get the market return. That's your reward for bearing risk, but not for completing the difficult active analysis about how to best allocate that risk.

> Right, labor is useless. Let's all just buy shares - they will magically produce everything on their own. They will grow food and create new technology.

Shares are partial ownership of companies, which are basically just groups of people organized into a process. I started this whole thread by criticizing the rail workers unions. Unions are a horrible way to organize workers. They are a democratic process that consist of votes. But you don't have time to do that when you're trying to execute under time pressure. Militaries are completely authoritarian. Companies are largely authoritarian as well. Democracy is great when you're trying to get things right, slowly. Authoritarian systems work when you're trying to do things quickly the best you can. Unions introduce democracy into what should be a fast authoritarian system. Instead, workers/investors should use democracy/decentralized decision making when allocating capital and picking corporate leaders. Then the corporation should be relatively authoritarian and execute quickly. It's like how a judge jury, prosecutor, and defense attorney are all four distinct jobs with four distinct roles in a trial. The same person can have all four jobs at different times in their life. But when they are fulfilling a specific role in a single case, they need to fulfill it the best they can.

The reason this matters is that one well organized and well run corporation can produce more food and create more new technology than millions of unorganized people working independently. There's a ton of ways to organize humans into various groups. And we've found that companies tend to work the best at improving the standard of living for humanity. Instead of disrupting that, we should just expand the ownership out to everyone in society.

The irony of all this is that capitalism is the most progressive/liberal economic idea ever created. Liberalism was created specifically in response to authoritarianism/monarchies. Liberalism means democracy, capitalism, and individual liberties. It spreads out the power and money from one king to everyone in society. Democracy was originally limited to white men in America, but the solution to the unfairness wasn't to get rid of democracy. It was to expand it to everyone including women and racial/ethnic minorities. Similarly, capitalism took power from the king and nobility and spread it out over a bunch more rich people. But the solution to wealth/income inequality isn't to kill it. It's to expand it to every single person in society. I'm never going to vote against my interests to benefit you. I'm relying on you to vote for your own interests so the best ideas come out on top. If you don't vote, then you're going to get screwed. Similarly, I'm expecting you to pursue your own financial interests, and I'm going to pursue mine. Like with voting, we can cooperate, compete, or focus on completely different things. But I'm expecting you to try to make money. If you're only relying on your labor and not on capital, then you're going to end up broke and there's going to be massive income/wealth inequality. The hardest part is that if you screw up early, you'll have less money/ability to dig yourself out of the hole. So there's a very strong incentive to get this right up front. That's what this sub is very indirectly about. 

I'll end this ridiculously long and out of place post by saying that profit and progress literally come from the same root word. It's absurd that capitalism and profit have become demonized by the left. I genuinely believe it comes from a place of ignorance. It's not anyone's fault. Economics/capitalism/investing is not taught in most high schools and it's not a required class in most colleges. Meanwhile, politics/democracy/voting is taught in basically every year of K-12 education. This is the biggest knowledge gap in America. The annoying part about this for me is that I'm completely left wing in pretty much ever sense of the word. But I was fortunate enough to study economics in school, and it's my favorite subject. I feel like antiworkers are to economics what antivaxxers are to biology. It sucks because they're both ideologies that push you away from the one thing that can help you. And the cost doesn't come right away. It comes later when you end up much poorer than the average person in society or you end up dying earlier than the average person in society. But I'm optimistic because people aren't that dumb and information is everywhere now. Eventually humanity will figure it out. But the sooner it happens, the better off we'll all be. Ok Alpha lmao I totally agree I just never trust myself with doing it but I do know what to do It should have a pull back but earnings coming soon I believe they figured that demand had peaked last quarter. yea i tried learning them to selling covered calls i can buy big amounts of shares but fuck slow and steady wins the race i just swing blue chip stocks right now i got a big position in tqqq do you trade naked calls? is it worth it? i know its fast big cash And wouldn't you know, there's another gates out there with a company called microhard. be careful, it creeps up on you slow and  can  hit you hard when it happens Got it, I’ve just started about 4 months in. Thanks friend, you too Just my 2 cents, but you do you bro 😎🤜 from the vomero you can see everything, it's a breathtaking view già check it out In the traditional sense of the word, sure. Think about it — the people engaging in that type of thing are people who have probably never experienced/learned unconditional love or have some type of emotional trauma where their worth is defined by what they can offer rather than who they are as a person. That’s pretty sad. Bro, you are on WSB lmao Bruh I can’t think of a bigger red flag. Let him be. hmm rough day today for gpk

why so confident? back-to-back boosters lander Now I'm really curious about why you bought CVNA - a dying company @ 28 Buy it low and sell after launch? I respect that, well done. There's no bias. I was genuinely inquiring one most recent data point that even indicates we are not headed in the right direction. Something, anything. If credit card debt has built from Q1 to Q2 that will count, when it comes out. LMAOO gay/bi men love to add the “bro” to act tough/straight. I know it Only one way to find out champ Thank you for your advice, lalittle. I will definitely keep that in mind as I continue my quest to become the richest person in the world. You should just throw it all into one stock and swing it for 20% at a time. That’s what I would do once I hit 100j Sooo invest in those? OY WE FUCKING DID IT, LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Pretty pricey for a BJ, most are like $5. Same fuck it. Hell I might throw 300. Let’s get rich brotha It was the illegal cock fight wasn’t it? [deleted] ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31224) hit me up bro, i swear reading that was like reading my past this  time last year. to a T. Even the numbers. 55k and 38k were mine. 

I'll help you gradually grow and compound safely. man fuck all that lol

Weed is not possibly worse than alcohol I do not, as I've only worked for state governments and haven't tried working at the IRS in years. I applied for years and never got an interview, but I'd check out this [site](https://www.jobs.irs.gov/) if you want more information.

The government doesn't provide great pay, but the benefits are off the charts. I know now there is more of a push to hire IRS agents than there was a decade or so ago. You gotta be careful making these bold predictions when you don't truly understand this stuff. You're gonna get humbled by the market. I say this because I've been there before. yeah executing and stay patient and diligent is literally the reason why people lose money

I was 128k down all time 8 week ago

now 98k down all time since I left my perma-bull life behind yeah but no way it keeps going up breaking ath every day for 1 more month before earnings No I just buy calls and puts. My best results have been longer term 4-8 months out. Usually get a couple shots at decent 75% + returns but best to also cut your losses. Once’s they drop it’s a battle to come back I’m 24 going on barely legal. Twink 4 lyfe Dont touch options. 

You're not ready and will blow your account. What if I go down on you bro? No homo No mate in every sense of the word. Traditional and current. Good fundamentals.

Valued at much more. 

Just look at their income, balance and cash flow.

The only reason it shouldn't go up is if the market drops. Which is likely if I'm honest. The carts looks good, I can give you a little more details if you want [deleted] I just wanna know where you’re getting ur confidence from ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258) True. That would be like an infinite money glitch. I used to say that until last Wednesday and the 3 reds following wait im confused.....you asking for advice or my positions......i aint no financial advisor......by the way this is WSB sir I do $25 a hand Not everyone charges the same as you. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258) Thank you sir! I only have enough for AMD ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883) I appreciate you man. I will definitely hit you up. Most likely tommorow if my account isn’t gone from those roku calls. I am in need of some perspective bad I’ve been there too, losing money buying puts since last year lol Think of it this way, people still have money, the Fed is still printing money. That money has to go somewhere and real estate is still stupid high. So I’m thinking billions if not trillions are going to keep going into the market and it won’t crash until people have a real reason to take it out I can never stay patient lol my biggest problem I bought some EOSE calls for September going to try and hold do you day trade or actually hold for months? cause man those 0dte do seem fun lol I see. i sorta squandered my mid 20s being with women  but at least they dominated me lol.  i still look  young  but im in my late 20s now  so meh Your ROI for just purchasing stocks are so slow Nah, im good 🤭 It's going to 6 dollars at least so even buying it at low 5s will be end of day profit Get a job dude Ik I plan on doing dumb things and running with profit if possible I think I’ve got $50 laying around… I’m the high end of the corner, gotta get those dolla bills. Puts or calls? lets have a big day today big guy!!!! >people still have money

Bank account, personal debt, and consumer discretionary spending data do not agree with a rosy picture here. Consumers have less and less money every month. The trend is down. Debt going up.

>the Fed is still printing money

Fed is sucking money out of the system right now. Both money supply and Fed balance sheet are falling. 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾 Your losses for not understanding options or the market are infinit. I thought we was homiesexuals in here but aight I just wanna know what makes you confident… lol wasn’t a chirp just genuinely curious Short a straddle lol get rid of those calls at open. 4H looks like an inverse cup and handle finishing the handle, or possibly the cup finishing and creating the handle. either outcome is downside. sell at open for all profit you can, and use the profit to re-position at the bounce of the handle(s) *consumers* have less, but it trickles up and the rich have to put their money somewhere Appreciate the advice, what brokerage platform do you use? Bro you even flairless 🤪 do you have a crush on me? Appreciate the heads up. I bought those calls on pure emotion. I looked at the chart for about three minutes and bought them right before close Now I just need to refrain from buying a 1dte beofre close tonight You can't have stocks going up perpetually with weak consumers. You have a ton of retirees in the country and they need real cashflow/dividends from the equity they hold. 

This is not meant as a personal attack but I believe this is one of (if not the) biggest bubble(s) in history and the most clueless money is buying here as the smart money and sharks offload ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882) Lol nvm my calls will be good If you want to scratch an itch, I've found its not so much the position or its size, but the want to be involved overnight.

that being said, if u need to scratch the itch, but 1dte spy calls / puts. find the top and bottom of this weeks range, and thats your lotto. 

9/10 times hits and satisfied the urge If smart money is offloading we couldn’t possibly be this high And your breath stinks 🤭 My problem right now is I’m feeling really desperate to get my account above 25 grand. There’s got another 5 grand. 50 thousand to 15 in a day Smart money has been offloading the last few weeks to people who don't understand the data and think this is a new bull market because that's what mainstream amateur investor sentiment says.

Hedge fund outflows 8 or 9 of the last 10 weeks while call buying reached a new record and retail funds flowed in to the market at close to their highest level ever. 

The market is lower than it was a week or two ago because of this selling pressure. I expect it to continue again rather soon. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|29637) I knew you was trying to makeout you liar this is what drove me to 0 fast. dont make the same mistake bro ugh bro im sorry. for real, hit me up. get out of trades,  u should NOT be trading today with how much emotion you have tied to these positions rn Maybe you’re right. But do you have a source for hedge fund outflows? You're right, the market is definitely under pressure from all of the selling by hedge funds. However, I think that retail investors are still bullish on the market and will continue to buy into any dips. This could create a situation where the market rallies in spite of all of the selling pressure from hedge funds. I said no, also cause you make poor choices 🤭 Improbably going to buy pfizer calls expiring tommroow and pray to god. If you could share any possible trades it would be helpful. Im at work and know deep down im going to pick the most risky play hoping to 5x it tommroow. I know i sound ridiculous right now I don’t really know what I should do. I should tkae it al out considering I have 500 in my bank account. This hurts. I had 50 grand yesterday Well I’m down 8000 now on the roku calls. I couldn’t get myself to sell. I think I’m going to call and try and get this PDT ban lifted and reset next week. Probably going to try and trade Friday https://twitter.com/SamanthaLaDuc/status/1671788473215270913

It was 9 of the last 10 sessions a few days ago. I did accidentally misquote that and take ownership of that. However, I actually think this is more damning than what I thought it was. Yeah that’s why you exist youre spiraling brother man, dont lose all your powder!!! give it a rest, the markets not going anywhere but YOU are if you lose it all! we can get u whole Thanks! I’ll look into that 🧐 Also you have no tatts I hear you. I needed to hear that right now. Im not going to hold anything over night tonight. Maybe a couple hundred to scratch that “itch”. You are absolutely right. I am spirally out of control right now. Really bad get a 392.5p for nvda, i have a few. thats all im overnighting.

im down 33% on the day myself, today is a tough day to trade.  what broker do u have? we'll rock 0dte spx tmrw for 5-10 baggers. I use Interactive Brokers. Let's make some money tomorrow! I use robinhood for placing orders because it seems to be the only one willing to approve me for buying and selling options. I use td ameritrade for the charts and info. What’s your thoughts on Nflx puts? Im thinking of putting a few hundred on those as well as Nvda I backed out on those puts because of the price action before close. Grabbed a thousand Pfe calls. And a thousand Amc calls… im thinking we might see a 4th of July pump going into the weekend. With that Vix pump and pce we could easily flip though. Wish i would’ve grabbed a few nvda puts though for some protection atleast pat yourself on the back big guy. you rationalized. now you know you *can* get a grip. the trick is *preventing* needing to get a grip. go look at tsla chart, shits gonna be nutty tmrw for calls. im thinking big rally as well. lets get in touch bro and bank tmrw i dont have friends who trade ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) I am with it man. I sent you a dm. I hear you though. Only people I can talk to about trading are people on the daily thread. Which doesn’t help much at all considering they’re gambling half the time Im definely not trying to blow up my account tommorow. But something’s bigs going to go down. Because my pdt ban got lifted and I’m honestly going to end up opening a 10 grand position sooner or later. Hopefully we don’t trade flat. If I knew I could’ve had my pdt ban lifted I would’ve never bought those roku calls. 8 grand gone for nothing"
